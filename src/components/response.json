The aim of this course is to highlight the neural basis of behavior and discuss modern approaches and novel methods to study the neuronal control of classically studied aspects of behavior. Through a combination of discussions, student presentations, and interactive lectures, we will explore the neural systems that regulate the interactions an animal has with the external world. We will explore sensory systems (such as vision, taste, and olfaction), motor systems, and survival behaviors (such as feeding, drinking, mating, and aggression). The course evaluation will be based largely on written work, participation, and presentations.\nBIOL/NRSC 2110 (was BIOL 251) is a required prerequisite for this course. Students who have completed Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology can submit a request for permission in Path@Penn. Requests will be reviewed and permission approved AFTER advance registration. Students who have not taken BIOL/NRSC 2110 should send an e-mail to bio-undergraduate@sas.upenn.edu with information on other relevant courses and/or motivation for taking this class.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.441,"instructor_quality":3.613,"difficulty":1.737,"work_required":1.826,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"PHYS-3364","title":"Laboratory Electronics","description":"A laboratory-intensive survey of analog and digital electronics, intended to teach students of physics or related fields enough electronics to be effective in experimental research and to be comfortable learning additional topics from reference textbooks.

Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering, for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere, including social systems, markets, molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model, analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments. Prerequisite: One compter language The class's material is divided in four blocks respectively dealing with Markov chains, continuous time Markov chains, Gaussian processes and stationary processes. Emphasis is placed in the development of toolboxes to analyze these different classes of processes and on describing their applications to complex stochastic systems in different disciplines. Particular examples include: (i) the problem of ranking web pages by a search engine; (ii) the study of reputation and trust in social networks; (iii) modeling and analysis of communication networks; (iv) the use of queues in the modeling of transportation networks; (v) stochastic modeling and simulation of biochemical reactions and gene networks; (vi) arbitrages, pricing of stocks, and pricing of options through Black-Scholes formula; and (vii) linear filtering of stochastic processes to separate signals of interest from background noise.
