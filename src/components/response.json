Beginning with the Haitian Revolution, much of black political thought (thinking and doing politics) has advocated group solidarity and cohesion in the face of often overwhelming conditions of servitude, enslavement and coercion within the political economy of slavery and the moral economy of white supremacy. Ideas and practices of freedom however, articulated by political actors and intellectuals alike, have been as varied as the routes to freedom itself. Thus, ideas and practices of liberty, citizenship and political community within many African and Afro-descendant communities have revealed multiple, often competing forms of political imagination. The multiple and varied forms of political imagination, represented in the writings of thinkers like Eric Williams, Richard Wright, Carole Boyce Davies and others, complicates any understanding of black political thought as having a single origin, genealogy or objective. Students will engage these and other authors in an effort to track black political thought's consonance and dissonance with Western feminisms, Marxism, nationalism and related phenomena and ideologies of the 20th and now 21st  century.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ACCT-6130","title":"Fin and Mngl Acct","description":"This course provides an introduction to both financial and managerial accounting, and emphasizes the analysis and evaluation of accounting information as part of the managerial processes of planning, decision-making, and control.

Individuals and firms confront risk in nearly all decisions they make. People face uncertainty in their choice of careers, spending and saving decisions, family choices, and many other facets of life. Similarly, the value that firms create by designing and marketing good products is at risk from a variety of sources. The bankruptcy of a key supplier, sharp rise in cost of financing, destruction of an important asset, impact of global warming, or a liability suit can quickly squander the value created by firms. In extreme cases, risky outcomes can bankrupt a firm, as has happened recently to manufacturers of automobile parts and a variety of financial service firms. The events since the Global Financial Crisis also offer stark reminders that risk can impose significant costs on individuals, firms, governments, and societ6y as a whole. This course explores how individuals and firms assess and evaluate risk, examines the tools available to successfully manage risk, and discusses real-world phenomena that limit the desired amount of risk-sharing.

Topics on gender will include workplace discrimination, policies to promote gender equality, the historical evolution of economic gender roles in the US, and initiatives to promote women's empowerment in developing countries. Topics on race will include an overview of historical economic exclusion and its consequences, the empirical measurement of discrimination, models of discrimination and their shortcomings, and how understanding hidden biases and historical barriers can increase firms' equity and performance. This course is complementary with MGMT 2240/MGMT 6240, and material will not overlap, so students especially interested in diversity issues should seek to take both courses. While MGMT 2240/MGMT 6240 focuses on evidence-based solutions for managing diversity, this course focuses on the economic science of race, gender, and discrimination: How do economists model bias? What does empirical evidence say about the benefits of diversity, and the harms of discrimination? How do we measure whether discrimination is still taking place, despite a growing awareness of diversity and inclusion? What is unique about women as economic agents, and how do we understand gender equality in the workplace in light of this? This class will equip students with economics models and empirical evidence that can serve as a toolkit to analyze both policy and business decisions. The format will be discussion based, with a short lecture each session and then active class discussion, drawing parallels between research and current events and news articles.

In 2019, the Business Roundtable composed of leading chief executive officers of U.S.-based companies released a statement that resurrected and reinforced interest in this view. This view contrasts with a traditional approach famously expressed by the economist Milton Friedman that \"the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.\" Although Friedman acknowledged normative side constraints to the profit motive--namely, a need to conform to the \"basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom\"--he did not see business as playing a central role in the creation and sustenance of these \"basic rules.\" As this course will explore in depth, Friedman's view has been challenged by various competing views of business purpose, such as in normative stakeholder theory and the related idea of \"shared value\"  The profit-maximizing view of business purpose is the one most frequently modeled in business school classes. But if business firms are conceived as social institutions that can themselves affect the \"basic rules of society\" rather than simply taking them as given, then the question becomes how business can or should do so. Take, for example, the global challenge of climate disruption treated in this course. Business operations are surely \"part of the problem\" in the sense of being the source of the production and release of large quantities of greenhouse gases every year. But can and should business also become \"part of the solution\"? If so, how? Do business firms have an ethical, if not a legal responsibility to minimize their own carbon footprints or other externally harmful actions? When social or environmental priorities collide directly with the profit motive, how should these competing mandates be properly reconciled? Similar questions may be asked (and touched on in this class) about other social challenges in the world today, including democratic values, poverty reduction, fresh water supplies, and global health issues affecting those less able to pay for life-saving drugs and medical services.\nWharton MBA course.

But in its earliest history it comprised a few small hamlets on a collection of hills adjacent to the Tiber river in central Italy. Over a period of nearly 1500 years, the Roman state transformed from a mythical Kingdom to a Republic dominated by a heterogeneous, competitive aristocracy to an Empire ruled, at least notionally, by one man. It developed complex legal and administrative structures, supported a sophisticated and highly successful military machine, and sustained elaborate systems of economic production and exchange. It was, above all, a society characterized both by a willingness to include newly conquered peoples in the project of empire, and by fundamental, deep-seated practices of social exclusion and domination. This course focuses in particular upon the history of the Roman state between the fifth century BCE and the third century CE, exploring its religious and cultural practices, political, social and economic structures.

However, there is a fixed amount of water on earth. As climate change makes many parts of the world hotter and drier, it is increasingly important for today’s business leaders to be able to understand water challenges and to implement solutions that will enable businesses to thrive in the future. In addition to understanding and navigating water quality and quantity challenges, business leaders thinking about water operate in a highly regulated environment at the local, national, and global levels. It is therefore important to understand who the key external stakeholders—both public and private—are and how to engage with them productively. Students are not expected to have any previous experience with the water industry.\nThis course will begin by focusing on global water risks and global, national, and local water governance. It will introduce students to how governments at many levels make and\nimplement water policy and how business leaders need to navigate managing water risks and opportunities within that environment. It will also cover private governance and water— considering how to engage with NGOs like the World Resources Institute and the CDP\n(formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) that operate on behalf of multiple stakeholders,\nincluding investors in this space. The course will examine the duties of corporate officers and directors in developing and implementing a firm’s water sustainability program, how major water projects are financed, and the business ethics issues surrounding “doing the right thing” in a module on water and ESG (environmental, social and governance factors). It will conclude with an “H2O Shark Tank” exercise where student groups pitch their best ideas for sustainable water solutions to a panel of potential funders, including investment banks, corporate executives, and foundation leaders.\nWharton MBA course.  \n\nMBA students must request enrollment for this class through Course Match and should not use the  \"Add to Cart\" or \"Request Permission\" functions.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"MGMT-6110","title":"Managing Est Enterprise","description":"This course is about managing large enterprises that face the strategic challenge of being the incumbent in the market and the organizational challenge of needing to balance the forces of inertia and change.

Beginning with the Haitian Revolution, much of black political thought (thinking and doing politics) has advocated group solidarity and cohesion in the face of often overwhelming conditions of servitude, enslavement and coercion within the political economy of slavery and the moral economy of white supremacy. Ideas and practices of freedom however, articulated by political actors and intellectuals alike, have been as varied as the routes to freedom itself. Thus, ideas and practices of liberty, citizenship and political community within many African and Afro-descendant communities have revealed multiple, often competing forms of political imagination. The multiple and varied forms of political imagination, represented in the writings of thinkers like Eric Williams, Richard Wright, Carole Boyce Davies and others, complicates any understanding of black political thought as having a single origin, genealogy or objective. Students will engage these and other authors in an effort to track black political thought's consonance and dissonance with Western feminisms, Marxism, nationalism and related phenomena and ideologies of the 20th and now 21st  century.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GSWS-2220","title":"African Women Lives Past/Pres","description":"Restoring women to African history is a worthy goal, but easier said than done.The course examines scholarship over the past forty years that brings to light previously overlooked contributions African women have made to political struggle, religious change, culture preservation, and economic development from pre-colonial times to present.

At the same time, financial markets play an important role in financing the transition to a net-zero economy. This role, however, is shaped by the information that is available to market participants. In this course, we examine how climate risks—both physical and regulatory—affect firms, financial markets (including carbon and renewable-energy certificate markets), and markets for energy and real estate. We examine the role that firms’ disclosures and third-party information sources play. As climate change is high on the agenda of almost every company and government, this course will be valuable both for students with the ambition to pursue a career centered around sustainability and those who want to gain a better understanding of how climate issues affect more traditional roles in the financial sector, consulting, or non-profits.\nThe starting point for this course is that financial market participants increasingly realize that climate change represents an important investment risk. One central concern focuses on transition risks, and in particular on the effects that regulatory responses to climate change have on the business models of carbon-intensive energy companies. We discuss how concerns about various climate risks influence the way investors allocate their capital and exercise their oversight of firms. We start with the price impacts of climate risks in equity, debt and real estate markets, including the role played by shareholder activism and engagement, divestment and portfolio alignment. Next, we study carbon markets with a focus on pricing and discuss strategies to hedge climate risks through financial instruments such as carbon or renewable-energy credits and derivative contracts. We then explore how different firms in the global energy sector—ranging from oil & gas to renewable energy to electric utilities—have responded to climate-related pressures from their investors and other stakeholders. Because outsiders’ reactions depend on the information that they have, we investigate the impact of ESG reporting on financial markets and on the choices that managers make. Here, we also discuss the costs and benefits of regulating ESG reporting and the impact of greenwashing.\nWe pay special attention to the impact of climate risk and reporting on decisions inside organizations, such as spin-offs, hedging, catastrophe insurance, and the structure of executive-compensation contracts. Further topics include life-cycle emissions and the social cost of carbon.\nWharton MBA course.

The meaning of one particular item of clothing can transform completely when moved across time and space. As one of many forms of expressive culture, dress shape and give forms to social bodies. In the study of dress and fashion, we could note two distinct broad approaches, the historical and the anthropological. While the former focuses on fashion as a western system that shifted across time and space, and linked with capitalism and western modernity; the latter approach defines dress as an assemblage of modification the body. The Africanist proponents of this anthropological approach insisted that fashion is not a dress system specific to the west and not tied with the rise of capitalism. This course will focus on studying the history of African dress by discussing the forces that have impacted and influenced it overtime, such as socio-economic, colonialism, religion, aesthetics, politics, globalization, and popular culture.

In the study of dress and fashion, we could note two distinct broad approaches, the historical and the anthropological. While the former focuses on fashion as a western system that shifted across time and space, and linked with capitalism and western modernity; the latter approach defines dress as an assemblage of modification the body. The Africanist proponents of this anthropological approach insisted that fashion is not a dress system specific to the west and not tied with the rise of capitalism. This course will focus on studying the history of African dress by discussing the forces that have impacted and influenced it overtime, such as socio-economic, colonialism, religion, aesthetics, politics, globalization, and popular culture.

Beginning with the Haitian Revolution, much of black political thought (thinking and doing politics) has advocated group solidarity and cohesion in the face of often overwhelming conditions of servitude, enslavement and coercion within the political economy of slavery and the moral economy of white supremacy. Ideas and practices of freedom however, articulated by political actors and intellectuals alike, have been as varied as the routes to freedom itself. Thus, ideas and practices of liberty, citizenship and political community within many African and Afro-descendant communities have revealed multiple, often competing forms of political imagination. The multiple and varied forms of political imagination, represented in the writings of thinkers like Eric Williams, Richard Wright, Carole Boyce Davies and others, complicates any understanding of black political thought as having a single origin, genealogy or objective.

What and who determines (in)eligibility regarding the everyday tools of good life and human survival? How are these determinations related to the differential distribution of potential and/or actual injury, harm, and damage to human life and the conditions of its survival? What can ethnographic insight contribute to our understanding of everydayness in Africa?  The roles of sexualities, gender, generation, humor, identities, racism, hate, memory, memorial, transactions, etc., in the construction, reconstruction, and deconstruction of daily life – and death – in the continent will be examined. Audio-visual materials will be used to analyze important themes about quotidian life in Africa.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"HIST-1177","title":"Afro Amer Hist 1876-Pres","description":"A study of the major events, issues, and personalities in Afro-American history from Reconstruction to the present.

The meaning of one particular item of clothing can transform completely when moved across time and space. As one of many forms of expressive culture, dress shape and give forms to social bodies. In the study of dress and fashion, we could note two distinct broad approaches, the historical and the anthropological. While the former focuses on fashion as a western system that shifted across time and space, and linked with capitalism and western modernity; the latter approach defines dress as an assemblage of modification the body. The Africanist proponents of this anthropological approach insisted that fashion is not a dress system specific to the west and not tied with the rise of capitalism. This course will focus on studying the history of African dress by discussing the forces that have impacted and influenced it overtime, such as socio-economic, colonialism, religion, aesthetics, politics, globalization, and popular culture. The course will also discuss the significance of the different contexts that impacted the choices of what constitute an appropriate  attire for distinct situations. African dress in this context is not a fixed relic from the past, but a live cultural item that is influenced by the surrounding forces.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"SOCI-2907","title":"Race, Rights and Rebellion","description":"This course provides an in-depth examination of theories of race and different kinds of social struggles for freedom around the globe.

Everyday life has been described by Agnes Heller (1978) as “the secret yeast of history.” What constitutes this “yeast of history” in contemporary Africa? In exploring everyday life, we will examine the existing (in)capacities in the structures of state and society in Africa for human well-being in relation to the differences between political life (bios) and bare life (zoe). The course engages with the everyday life in terms of how social, economic, and political lives are constituted and the implications of this process for whether Africans live well or not, how they die, and their struggles for alternative lives.

At the same time, financial markets play an important role in financing the transition to a net-zero economy. This role, however, is shaped by the information that is available to market participants. In this course, we examine how climate risks—both physical and regulatory—affect firms, financial markets (including carbon and renewable-energy certificate markets), and markets for energy and real estate. We examine the role that firms’ disclosures and third-party information sources play. As climate change is high on the agenda of almost every company and government, this course will be valuable both for students with the ambition to pursue a career centered around sustainability and those who want to gain a better understanding of how climate issues affect more traditional roles in the financial sector, consulting, or non-profits.\nThe starting point for this course is that financial market participants increasingly realize that climate change represents an important investment risk. One central concern focuses on transition risks, and in particular on the effects that regulatory responses to climate change have on the business models of carbon-intensive energy companies. We discuss how concerns about various climate risks influence the way investors allocate their capital and exercise their oversight of firms. We start with the price impacts of climate risks in equity, debt and real estate markets, including the role played by shareholder activism and engagement, divestment and portfolio alignment. Next, we study carbon markets with a focus on pricing and discuss strategies to hedge climate risks through financial instruments such as carbon or renewable-energy credits and derivative contracts. We then explore how different firms in the global energy sector—ranging from oil & gas to renewable energy to electric utilities—have responded to climate-related pressures from their investors and other stakeholders. Because outsiders’ reactions depend on the information that they have, we investigate the impact of ESG reporting on financial markets and on the choices that managers make. Here, we also discuss the costs and benefits of regulating ESG reporting and the impact of greenwashing.\nWe pay special attention to the impact of climate risk and reporting on decisions inside organizations, such as spin-offs, hedging, catastrophe insurance, and the structure of executive-compensation contracts. Further topics include life-cycle emissions and the social cost of carbon.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"FNCE-8120","title":"Fnce Econ Law of Fiscal Crises","description":"The focus will be on the causes of fiscal crises, a careful detailing of who wins and who loses, and then on how such crises might be resolved and, perhaps most importantly, how they might be prevented in the future.

The cost of such crises for citizens, pensioners, and bond holders can be significant. We seek to understand the underlying economic, political, and legal/regulatory causes of such events so that they may be prevented in the future. The importance of private information and public regulation for disciplining the fiscal performance of democratically elected governments will be a central concern. We believe strongly that diagnosing and treating the \"disease\" of fiscal mismanagement is an interdisciplinary endeavor drawing on finance, economics, political science, and the law.

This seminar reframes it, to test productive models to understand visual culture outside the empire’s Italian heartland from the Late Republic into Late Antiquity, in the Roman polity’s  interactions with many peoples in situations of diaspora, colonization, hegemony, conflict, economic exchange, and religious interaction. As `Rome’ expanded, cultural relations across many borderlines – social, ethnic, territorial  - potentially became cultural politics. A traditional topic for that has been Roman interaction with Greek culture. This seminar extends that range, while tackling `Hellenization’, as we reflect on models of `Romanization’, globalism and identity formation within the imperium’s boundaries in its provinces and client kingdoms, and also at its frontier zones. Various disciplines apply: art history, archaeology, history, and more. Case studies, evolved with students, may range from Britain to Iran, northern Africa to the Black Sea in space and, in time, from interactions with the Hellenistic East and West and with Iron Age Europe, to the age of Germanic, Sasanian and Ummayad conquests of Roman terrain, ca 3rd c. BCE-7th c. CE. The market in art and artifact, the nature and status of makers, and conditions of patronage and viewing are key considerations. Private and public objects, images, architecture and urbanism, and landscapes can all concern us, as we try out disciplinary approaches that take in eg cultural appropriation, translation and hybrity, creolization, discrepant experience, object agency, and communities of taste and style.  `Ethnicity’ is a loaded concept in ancient Mediterranean studies, as is `race;’ our course must engage those, and the ways in which things and styles have been made to serve those terms. And who owns, is heir to, the cultural legacies we look at, and how to name them, are problems that tangle with current national identity formation, and academic and museum practice.

This seminar extends that range, while tackling `Hellenization’, as we reflect on models of `Romanization’, globalism and identity formation within the imperium’s boundaries in its provinces and client kingdoms, and also at its frontier zones. Various disciplines apply: art history, archaeology, history, and more. Case studies, evolved with students, may range from Britain to Iran, northern Africa to the Black Sea in space and, in time, from interactions with the Hellenistic East and West and with Iron Age Europe, to the age of Germanic, Sasanian and Ummayad conquests of Roman terrain, ca 3rd c. BCE-7th c. CE. The market in art and artifact, the nature and status of makers, and conditions of patronage and viewing are key considerations. Private and public objects, images, architecture and urbanism, and landscapes can all concern us, as we try out disciplinary approaches that take in eg cultural appropriation, translation and hybrity, creolization, discrepant experience, object agency, and communities of taste and style.  `Ethnicity’ is a loaded concept in ancient Mediterranean studies, as is `race;’ our course must engage those, and the ways in which things and styles have been made to serve those terms. And who owns, is heir to, the cultural legacies we look at, and how to name them, are problems that tangle with current national identity formation, and academic and museum practice. Our own Museum's holdings can make topics. Students are welcome to bring in interests in language and text cultures, in disciplines outside art history and archaeology, and in other world cultures and epochs.\nUNDERGRADUATES CAN ENROLL WITH PERMISSION.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"BE-2200","title":"Biomaterials","description":"This course investigates the application of materials science and engineering to biomedical applications, with a focus on polymers, ceramics, and metals.

The musics of different cultures cover a wide range of styles, but also display fascinating similarities, and a number of features are shared by even the most disparate musical traditions. Within our own culture, music is inescapable-there are very few individuals who do not listen to some form of music every day and far more who listen to music virtually all day long. Appreciation of music comes very early: newborns prefer music to normal speech and mothers all over the world sing to their babies in a fundamentally similar way. And yet, despite this seeming ubiquity, the real origin and purpose of music remains unknown. Music is obviously related to language, but how? Why do so many cultures make music in such fundamentally similar ways? What goes into the formation of music \"taste\" and preferences? Does music have survival value, or is it merely \"auditory cheesecake\", a superfluous byproduct of evolution as some critics have maintained? What is the nature of musical ability and how do musicians differ from non-musicians?  In this course, we will look for answers by looking at the brain. Almost 200 years of scientific research into brain mechanisms underlying the production and appreciation of music is beginning to shed light on these and other questions. Although the sciences and the arts are often seen as entirely separate or even in opposition, studying the brain is actually telling us a lot about music, and studying music is telling us just as much about the brain.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":2.764,"instructor_quality":3.231,"difficulty":1.605,"work_required":1.389,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"PSYC-3232","title":"The Social Brain","description":"This seminar examines the cognitive and neural mechanisms that enable humans to predict and understand people's behavior.

We'll begin with renowned scholar of the emotions, Brene Brown, and her latest book, Atlas of the Heart, which explores 87 emotions and related experiences. What distinguishes Brown from many other scholars in this interdisciplinary field is that she writes to a generalist audience and connects the scholarship to everyday experiences. While her writing is very accessible, it's grounded in substantial research and has broad applications to health, wildlife/animal studies, urban planning, economics, education, childhood development, marketing, rhetoric, artificial intelligence, the arts -- in short, every situation that involves humans experiencing, interpreting, and reacting to their own and others' feelings. Brown is especially well known for her work on shame and vulnerability, and methods for becoming \"shame resilient,\" but her book addresses a rich range of studies and work on numerous emotions and the language we use to describe them. The book is also fascinating insofar as she designed it for contemporary readers/use, with a lot of art, graphics, cartoons, and breakout pages that are designed for social media use. After reading and analyzing this lively, thought-provoking book, students will develop research projects on topics of their choice and use their findings to write a research-based White Paper and an Op-Ed.

Seminar enrollment is capped at 12. Students in the Craft of Prose sections get additional individualized feedback and mentoring from tutors as well as their instructor. Craft of Prose seminars are best suited to students who are intellectually gifted but struggle with one or more of the following: writing- or reading-related anxiety; perfectionism; organization; managing time and assignment submission; insufficient reading or writing practice in high school; or other writing-related challenges. This seminar fulfills the writing requirement, follows the same curriculum, and has the same workload, assessment process and standards as all other writing seminars at Penn. Only first-year and sophomores are eligible to enroll in Craft of Prose. For more information, please copy and paste the following link into your browser: apps.sas.upenn.edu/writing/ccs/catalog.php\nThis course will examine current research on emotions. We'll begin with renowned scholar of the emotions, Brene Brown, and her latest book, Atlas of the Heart, which explores 87 emotions and related experiences. What distinguishes Brown from many other scholars in this interdisciplinary field is that she writes to a generalist audience and connects the scholarship to everyday experiences. While her writing is very accessible, it's grounded in substantial research and has broad applications to health, wildlife/animal studies, urban planning, economics, education, childhood development, marketing, rhetoric, artificial intelligence, the arts -- in short, every situation that involves humans experiencing, interpreting, and reacting to their own and others' feelings. Brown is especially well known for her work on shame and vulnerability, and methods for becoming \"shame resilient,\" but her book addresses a rich range of studies and work on numerous emotions and the language we use to describe them. The book is also fascinating insofar as she designed it for contemporary readers/use, with a lot of art, graphics, cartoons, and breakout pages that are designed for social media use. After reading and analyzing this lively, thought-provoking book, students will develop research projects on topics of their choice and use their findings to write a research-based White Paper and an Op-Ed. Other shorter assignments will include logical reasoning exercises, academic reading and research, professional peer review, and writing for businesses and nonprofits.

We will read the work of musicologists, cultural theorists, urban geographers, sociologists and educators who work to define urban space and the role of music and sound in urban environments, including through music education. While the readings make up our study of the sociology of urban space and the way we use music in everyday life to inform our conversations and the questions we ask, it is within the context of our personal experiences working with music programs in public neighborhood schools serving economically disadvantaged students, that we will begin to formulate our theories of the contested musical micro-cultures of West Philadelphia. This course is over two-semesters where students register for .5 cus each term (for a total of 1 cu over the entire academic year) and is tied to the Music and Social Change Residential Program in Fisher Hassenfeld College House which will sponsor field trips around the city and a final concert for youth to perform here at Penn, if possible.

First you will encounter theories for communicating climate research in sounds, images, and embodied practices. You will apply these theories to analyze exemplary audiovisual projects. Then you will connect with your university’s digital scholarship librarian and visit a media lab to help you shift from theoretical to technical aspects of creating a digital exhibit and recording sounds and images. \n \nAfter agreeing on a local climate problem that the exhibit will address, you will then form teams focused on creating different components of the overall exhibit: on the sound team, you might combine field recordings and recorded interviews into a short podcast episode; on the image team, you might create photo or video essays; on the education team, you might create public educational resources like DIY monitoring kits, reading lists, or create/improve relevant Wikipedia articles; on the interface team, you might link your skills in electrical engineering or environmental monitoring to build interfaces that connect bodies with real-time, local air quality measurements. Or you might devise an altogether different team in consultation with the professor. \n \nThe course culminates in a public showcase of each team’s contribution to the digital exhibit.

This course examines how modern media engage in the rhetorical art of persuasion. Rather than focusing on social media, we'll be looking at professional media: everything from news to advertising to entertainment. We're bombarded with media rhetoric daily, and often we're aware of it as a means of manipulating our thoughts and actions, yet we consume and often succumb. We're all products of our media's unrelenting rhetorical machinations. In this seminar we'll study the rhetoric of persuasion in modern media, its historical development, and the ways it draws us into its milieu. We'll investigate how these media unite us and divide us, and hopefully come to understand them well enough to resist being pawns of the rhetoric we encounter. As a student in this seminar, you'll learn much about rhetorical strategies, critical thinking, and critical writing theory and practice. You'll produce two major pieces, a white paper and an op-ed, as well as shorter assignments designed to increase your writing knowledge and your self-awareness as a writer: keys to meeting the writing tasks in your future.

A city is gained or lost; missile strikes begin; forces are repelled; defenders are pressured; ground offensives are conducted. But during all of this, ordinary people are living---or at least trying to survive. Over one billion people around the world currently live in conflict zones. They must find food, water, and medicine every day, entertain children, and mark religious holidays. Violence changes how families live, and perhaps where they live, perhaps how many members of the family live, but community life does not disappear when war comes to town. This course uses anthropologist Michael Jackson's In Sierra Leone as a guide to exploring how ordinary people negotiate warfare they neither caused nor control.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":6,"course_quality":2.565,"instructor_quality":3.154,"difficulty":2.362,"work_required":3.134,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"WRIT-0250","title":"Writing Seminar in CIMS","description":"This writing seminar focuses on a scholarly inquiry in the field of Cinema & Media studies, the study of the history, theory, and production of film & media.

Cameras promise to show us the \"truth,\" allowing us to create, or contest, collective and individual narratives. The documentary tradition builds on older practices of portraiture, cultural exhibition, and historical documentation. At present, this tradition spans from sweeping historical narratives, to forensics-obsessed true crime series, to guilty-pleasure reality television. In this course, we will examine the visual and verbal rhetoric of these documentaries: How does the popular, documentary version of the \"truth\"? compare with its scholarly counterpart? How do these stories shape identities? How do scholars interpret the truths documentaries present to us?

More than geographical fractures, the establishment of these new, and largely arbitrary, national borders provoked one of the largest mass migrations in recent history, and with it, large-scale communal violence, illness, and deaths. Migrants' journeys to their new homelands, moreover, only just began upon crossing borders. Settlement in new, adopted homelands entailed staking claim to particular places and adhering to the fast-changing political and commercial bureaucracies of infant nation states. In this seminar, we will read Sarah Ansari and William Gould???s Boundaries of Belonging: Localities, Citizenship and Rights in India and Pakistan to analyze the ways in which subjects of India and Pakistan formed relations with their new governments. We will consider, in turn, the ways in which various groups, human and material -- from women, tribal, and low-caste populations, to prices and goods -- were identified, controlled, and branded as subjects and products of these new nations. Understanding these will help us to think and write critically about bureaucratic control and mediation across time and place.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":2,"course_quality":2.982,"instructor_quality":3.597,"difficulty":2.233,"work_required":3.165,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ECON-4205","title":"","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":0,"course_quality":2.77,"instructor_quality":2.92,"difficulty":3.0,"work_required":2.64,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"HCIN-6190","title":"Pitching Innovation","description":"Students will use the skills and techniques learned in Translating Ideas into Outcomes (HCIN-6070) to construct a plan for an innovation project that addresses an exigent issue in their professional settings.

Resilience and sustainability are paradigmatic concepts for the ways in which cities address the effects associated with global warming: sea level rise, extreme weather, changing climate, and their impacts on water, food, energy, and housing. This course focuses on the cultural side of resilience and sustainability in four signature cities: Rotterdam (with areas 6 meters below sea level), Nijmegen (which has devised a new way to live with a major river), New York City (which was devastated by Hurricane Sandy), and New Orleans (one of the most vulnerable American cities). Of course, other cities (Amsterdam, Arnhem, Boston, The Hague, Houston, Miami, etc.) will also come into play. In deeply uncertain times, cities such as these confront an array of interconnected choices that involve not only infrastructural solutions, but priorities, values, and cultural predispositions. Ideally, the strategies that cities devise are generated through inclusive processes based on the understanding that resilience and sustainability should be grounded in the cultural life of their communities. When this is the case, resilience and sustainability can become unique and motivating narratives about how cities and their residents co-develop the kinds of hard, soft, and social infrastructure the climate emergency requires. With this in mind, we will analyze the cities’ climate action plans and resilience strategies; explore their cultural histories relative to flooding events; and consult with Dutch and American experts in climate adaptation, governance, community development, and design. The highlight of the course will be travel to the Netherlands during spring break for site visits and discussions with experts.\nThis course is a Penn Global Seminar, which includes a travel component.

Students receive close mentoring to develop and execute cross-disciplinary, public engagement projects on the environment.  In spring 2018, participants have the opportunity to participate in PPEH's public engagement projects on urban waters and environmental data. These ongoing projects document the variety of uses that Philadelphians make of federal climateand environmental data, in and beyond city government; they also shine light onclimate and environmental challenges our city faces and the kinds of data we need to address them. Working with five community partners across Philadelphia, including the City's Office of Sustainability, students in this course will develop data use stories and surface the specific environmental questions neighborhoods have and the kinds of data they find useful. The course hosts guest speakers and research partners from related public engagement projects across the planet; community, neighborhood, open data, and open science advocates; and project partners in government in the City of Philadelphia and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Spurning the traditional sectoral divisions of industry, the digital economy names those businesses that rely on the centrality of information technology, data, and the internet whether they be in manufacturing, services, transportation, mining, or telecommunications. Within this digital economy, the platform has emerged as the premier business model intended to organize, extract, monopolize, and use colossal amounts of data. The proliferation of platforms encompasses a range of disparate firms, including those in tech (Google, Facebook, and Amazon), start-ups (Uber, Airbnb), industry (GE, Siemens), and agriculture (John Deere, Monsanto). How exactly do platforms marshal data to increase profits for capital? If platforms are made possible by emergent technologies, how can we historicize this emergence within longer-running and deeper capitalist tendencies? To what extent do platforms auger more fundamental transformations in the organization of capitalism itself? What are the implications of platform capitalism for the politics of the future?

Scholars have long pointed to the Mycenaean civilization, which flourished on the mainland of Greece in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600–1200 B.C.), as the inspiration for the Homeric stories. In this course, we will examine the archaeology of the great centers of the Late Bronze Age in Greece and Anatolia, particularly Mycenae, Pylos, and Troy. Our main aim will be to better understand the social, political, and economic context of this Late Bronze Age world, which may shed light on the possibility that a “Trojan War” of some kind actually occurred. The primary focus on archaeology is supplemented by readings from Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ECON-7310","title":"Econometrics II: Methods","description":"Analysis in time and frequency domains, state space representations, Kalman filtering, conditional heteroskedasticity, nonlinear and nonparametric methods for time series, integration, co-integration, numerical and simulation techniques.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ECON-8210","title":"Quant Macro-Econ Theory","description":"Computation of Equilibria.

The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.

To make this decision, you likely assessed factors like whether food items were affordable or expensive, organic or processed, and if they were craft or mass-produced. These distinctions allow us to see that the food we eat may mean more than sustenance. Thus, in this class, we will employ a sociological lens to understand the meanings we give to food. We will explore how our meanings for food allow people to do things such as develop tastes, construct identities, gain membership to gastronomic systems, and distinguish categories of people (e.g., class). As we gain a greater understanding of these food meanings, we will be able to make sense of food trends such as the rise of gourmet, organic, ethnic, and diet foods.

Resilience and sustainability are paradigmatic concepts for the ways in which cities address the effects associated with global warming: sea level rise, extreme weather, changing climate, and their impacts on water, food, energy, and housing. This course focuses on the cultural side of resilience and sustainability in four signature cities: Rotterdam (with areas 6 meters below sea level), Nijmegen (which has devised a new way to live with a major river), New York City (which was devastated by Hurricane Sandy), and New Orleans (one of the most vulnerable American cities). Of course, other cities (Amsterdam, Arnhem, Boston, The Hague, Houston, Miami, etc.) will also come into play. In deeply uncertain times, cities such as these confront an array of interconnected choices that involve not only infrastructural solutions, but priorities, values, and cultural predispositions. Ideally, the strategies that cities devise are generated through inclusive processes based on the understanding that resilience and sustainability should be grounded in the cultural life of their communities. When this is the case, resilience and sustainability can become unique and motivating narratives about how cities and their residents co-develop the kinds of hard, soft, and social infrastructure the climate emergency requires. With this in mind, we will analyze the cities’ climate action plans and resilience strategies; explore their cultural histories relative to flooding events; and consult with Dutch and American experts in climate adaptation, governance, community development, and design. The highlight of the course will be travel to the Netherlands during spring break for site visits and discussions with experts.\nThis course is a Penn Global Seminar, which includes a travel component.

We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.

What distinguishes Brown from many other scholars in this interdisciplinary field is that she writes to a generalist audience and connects the scholarship to everyday experiences. While her writing is very accessible, it's grounded in substantial research and has broad applications to health, wildlife/animal studies, urban planning, economics, education, childhood development, marketing, rhetoric, artificial intelligence, the arts -- in short, every situation that involves humans experiencing, interpreting, and reacting to their own and others' feelings. Brown is especially well known for her work on shame and vulnerability, and methods for becoming \"shame resilient,\" but her book addresses a rich range of studies and work on numerous emotions and the language we use to describe them. The book is also fascinating insofar as she designed it for contemporary readers/use, with a lot of art, graphics, cartoons, and breakout pages that are designed for social media use.

The course will take an interdisciplinary approach to situating martial arts practices in history through an examination of religious, literary, and visual sources, against the backdrop of theoretical approaches from across gender studies, anthropology, and cultural theory. The course will be divided into three units. The first unit will focus on the cultural background that led to the emergence of martial arts practices in the pre-modern period. We will examine classical discourses on the human body and its cultivation and the role of medical practices and religious institutions, such as the Shaolin Temple, in the development of martial arts regimens. In the second unit, we will discuss the spread and popularization of martial arts practices in late imperial and modern Chinese society through a close reading of literary sources, such as wuxia novels and other works of fiction. In addition, we will explore the modernization and re-invention of martial arts in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when China attempts to re-establish itself as a modern nation.  The third and final unit will be devoted to the global impact of Chinese martial arts in contemporary popular culture.

Fun but hard-hitting. Popular music is not just entertaining: it presents societal issues, raises questions, expresses ideas. This course considers how popular music of the 20th century manifested the hopes, contradictions, ingenuity, and challenges of life in the United States, as seen and heard through the experiences of musicians and audiences. We will address three core questions: (1) How is “talent” and “good” music distinguished? (2) What happens when we treat music as “property,” especially with respect to broader ideas of ownership and credit? (3) When, how, and why is music considered dangerous? We delve into these questions by profiling musicians’ lives, analyzing the musical traits of specific repertoire, investigating changes in how music circulates, and situating popular music in U.S. cultural history. This course is not a chronological survey and does not aim to cover all U.S. popular music (or global popular music). Instead, each core question is addressed through case studies. Over the course of the semester students learn listening and analytic skills, how to engage critically with a range of writings about music, how to develop compelling arguments and articulate them verbally in class discussions and in writing assignments.\nThis course is an introduction to the study of popular music, broadly understood but taken here to focus mainly, though not exclusively, on a narrower subset of genres such as pop, rock, rhythm and blues, funk, hip-hop, and jazz. Our course will consider how, like that of 20th and 21st century Western Art Music (including, but not limited to contemporary classical, jazz, opera, etc.), several forms of American popular music – both in composition and performance – derive not only from one’s life experience, but also address the challenges and complexities of life in the United States and create work that gives a fresh take on these experiences. The primary methodology of this class is to understand, think about, and discuss popular music by developing a practice of engaged, thoughtful listening. This will include extensive discussion and individual short essays on the recordings that also serve, in part, as “texts”: students are therefore expected to intimately familiarize themselves with the musical content prior to and during class time. While this course is designed largely for listening and critiquing music, it also draws upon literature by musicians, singers/songwriters, lyricists, and may draw from African American studies, spontaneous and formal composition, performance, musicology, and ethnomusicology. All classes will consist of listening to mini-mixtapes, extended discussions on the music, film viewings, readings, and debates. We will consider groove, texture, rhythm, melody, harmony, and form over the course of the semester, while also developing listening and analytic skills and critical engagement and discussion on the music heard inside and outside of class, as well as on writings about music.\nRegistration is restricted to students with a Music Major or Minor.

Throughout the semester, we will explore the social, political, and cultural contexts of martial arts practice, from the classical period to the 21st century. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach to situating martial arts practices in history through an examination of religious, literary, and visual sources, against the backdrop of theoretical approaches from across gender studies, anthropology, and cultural theory. The course will be divided into three units. The first unit will focus on the cultural background that led to the emergence of martial arts practices in the pre-modern period. We will examine classical discourses on the human body and its cultivation and the role of medical practices and religious institutions, such as the Shaolin Temple, in the development of martial arts regimens. In the second unit, we will discuss the spread and popularization of martial arts practices in late imperial and modern Chinese society through a close reading of literary sources, such as wuxia novels and other works of fiction. In addition, we will explore the modernization and re-invention of martial arts in the late 19th centuryand early 20th century, when China attempts to re-establish itself as a modern nation.

Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depend upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts.  With a diverse group of readings--autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthrology, and literary theory--this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture. What does it mean to translate? How do we read a text in translation? What does it mean to live between two languages? Who is a translator?

We start with a discussion of the definition, scope, and methodology of economics, reading Robbins on the definition of economics, Mill on the science of political economy and Friedman’s essay on methodology, along with some of its critical responses.  We then consider three central concepts of economics which have their roots in philosophy:  rationality, utility, and welfare, and we examine the philosophical assumptions in each of these economic concepts.\nEconomics assumes a form of instrumental rationality by which individuals seek to maximize their utility.  We consider the origins of this concept of rationality, its extension into rational choice theory, and the critiques it has inspired.  Our next topic is the concept of utility, which originates in philosophy but which receives a technical definition in economics.  Finally, we turn to welfare economics, which is the most normative part of economic science, where we consider topics such as preference satisfaction and interpersonal comparisons of utility.  We also raise the question throughout whether these concepts are rightly used in economics, and whether welfare economics can in fact promote well-being.\nIn addition to the four major topics (methodology, rationality, utility, and welfare), we will also devote one class each to four topics debated in journal articles by some of the most important economists in recent history.  These topics are:\n\t--Is underinvestment in basic research a market failure?  (Arrow v. Demsetz);\n\t--What are the market consequences of imperfect information? (Hayek v. Stiglitz);\n\t--What are the moral dimensions of economic growth, specifically as it relates to the environment? (B. Friedman v. T. Jackson);\n\t--Is it ethical for the state to “nudge” citizens towards desired behaviors? (Thaler and Sunstein v. Grüne-Yanoff); and\nReviewing the views expressed in these debates will allow students to form their own opinions on major topics in economics where the arguments are largely philosophical.  The goal of the overall course is to help students develop a more critical understanding of the assumptions of economics as it’s practiced as a social science.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ANCH-1205","title":"Race & Ethnicity Ancient World","description":"Modern political and artistic movements often appeal to an ancient past in order to construct their own social and racial identities.

This volume, which compiled and discussed the recipes of eighth- and ninth-century Islamic rulers (caliphs) and their courts in Iraq, represents the oldest known surviving cookbook of the Arab-Islamic world. Many more such cookbooks followed; in their day they represented an important literary genre among cultured elites. As one food historian recently noted, there are more cookbooks in Arabic from before 1400 than in the rest of the worlds languages put together. Ibn Sayyars cookbook can help us to think about the historical and cultural d ynamics of food. In this class, we will focus on the Middle East across the sweep of the Islamic era, into the modern period, and until the present day, although many of the readings will consider the study of food in other places (including the contemporary United States) for comparative insights. The class will use the historical study of food and foodways as a lens for examining subjects that relate to a wide array of fields and interests. These subjects include economics, agricultural and environmental studies, anthropology, literature, religion, and public health. With regard to the modern era, the course will pay close attention to the consequences of food for shaping memories and identities including religious, ethnic, national, and gender-based identities particularly among people who have dispersed or otherwise migrated. It will also focus considerably on the politics of food, that is, on the place of food in power relations. Among the questions we will debate are these: How does food reflect, shape, or inform history? By approaching the study of Middle Eastern cultures through food, what new or different things can we see? What is the field of food studies, and what can it offer to scholars?

Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depend upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts.  With a diverse group of readings--autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthrology, and literary theory--this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture.

Health capability captures the dynamic, interactive, multidimensionality of health and flourishing. Health capability has the effect of creating a virtuous circle; developing people's health capability enables them to create and support the conditions for their own and other's health capability and so forth. It offers an evaluation of the aim and success of public policies in terms of people's lived experiences. The course is motivated by the idea that health capabilities ought to be a primary dimension in which equity in health and public policy is sought.  The course includes three parts. The first part engages with the health capability model. The second part examines the health capability profile. The third part explores health capability applications. Twin goals of the course include cultivating the development of students' knowledge base, values and competencies as well as aiding students in identifying, assessing and expanding their own health capabilities for individual and community health and flourishing.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.5,"instructor_quality":3.5,"difficulty":2.0,"work_required":2.67,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"FNCE-2320","title":"International Banking","description":"(Formerly FNCE 220) This course focuses on international financial institutions, especially the activities of global, systemically important banks.

Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as a few contemporary American ones, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? We investigate these questions through a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals, religion and family, sex, love, madness, and death.\nCourse offered by Penn LPS Online.

In this very hands-on course, we will resurrect this age-old practice by exploring the tried and true presentation methods and approaches while simultaneously making direct connections to how technology has transformed presentation speaking in organizations. We will initially explore the fundamentals of public presentations: what makes an effective presentation, the arguments for developing strong presentation skills, and specific analysis of business speech. How does one establish proper credibility and build the trust necessary for success? Where does structure play a role and how can certain elements from theater, storytelling, and narrative help create highly impactful organizational presentations. We'll explore what determines ethical presentations, where charisma (or lack thereof) plays a role, and how to most effectively incorporate visual accompaniments such as PowerPoint into presentations. We will dig much  deeper into the development of strong persuasive arguments with emphasis on how social media has impacted credibility in novel ways.

Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organization determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. More formally, managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by taking a \"system\" view of organizations,which means that we examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people, and outputs, and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate.

We’ll examine past anxieties related to automation and evaluate the extent to which the “worst-case” scenarios about employment loss have or have not come to pass – and evaluate claims of “this time it’s different”.\n•\tModule 2: “Intelligent Technologies: How Will They Affect Work and Organizations?” explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing core “managing people” activities (e.g., hiring and performance appraisal) – plus shifting the locus of management away from human bosses and into algorithms.  We’ll examine controversies around “gig work”, i.e., the positives of worker schedule flexibility vs. the negatives of algorithmic control.  We’ll also consider the metaverse and its potential for unleashing human creativity and fostering richer and more nuanced virtual communication - as well as providing organizations with new ways to monitor and control.\n•\tModule 3: “Technology and Policy” examines three policy issues.  First, how can we inject more ethical criteria into the development of artificial intelligence and algorithms affecting work?  Second, what are the pros and cons of “universal basic income”, whose premise is that technological change will soon lead to an unprecedented amount of job elimination?

We next move into an investigation of the anatomy of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) with an emphasis on neurodevelopment. With the above knowledge in hand, we move into the sensory systems and investigate smell, hearing, vision, and pain sensation by focusing on how physical stimuli (such as sound waves) are converted into neural signals, where these signals travel in the brain, and how they are processed. We finish the course with an investigation into the function of the various motor systems and the autonomic nervous system.\nWhen you register for NEUR 1000, you are automatically enrolled in a mandatory neuroscience learning assessment to gauge your prior knowledge of biology and chemistry and help prepare you for the course. The learning assessment can be found in Canvas and must be completed before NEUR 1000 begins; it is recommended that you begin the learning assessment at least a week in advance. This learning assessment helps you get familiarized with baseline knowledge that you need before beginning the course and enables all students to begin the course with the same baseline knowledge. Completing the assessment accurately takes 2-10 hours. You can review the materials as many times as you want. We encourage you to earn a passing score in this assessment to be successful in completing the NEUR 1000 course.

Students may choose either to produce a comprehensive project proposal that clearly details a plan of future work or continue to work on a capstone already in progress. From the get-go, you should be thinking about the development of your project—who and what you want to study, your research questions, and the significance of your capstone to individuals, organizations, and the “human side” of work. Empirically-driven research provides professionals and organization the potential to adopt a critical and reflexive view about the social world of business and its core processes.\nFor students focused specifically on their MSOD or MPhil Capstone, this course can provide a strong foundation in specific qualitative and quantitative methodologies. This course focuses on how to successfully write a Research Capstone—the essential “ingredients” of each chapter, including how to devise a clear and narrow research agenda, and academic writing strategies that fuse the scholarly and applied goals of your work. We will explore what scholarly sources are and the necessity of their presence in the Research Capstone, inductive and deductive approaches to developing your research questions and conceptual framework, as well as a timeline for capstone completion. Students are required to submit a completed application to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pennsylvania; the IRB application spells out the ethical soundness of the student’s project objectives and goals for including human subjects in their work, as well as their methodological and sampling rationale. If this course is taken late in the student’s Masters degree program, the student can petition to take this course in place of DYNM 705 capstone course.  Such a petition will be considered on an individual case basis.\nStudents work in collaborative learning groups throughout the semester to foster community, to critique and analyze various parts of past research capstones and scholarly works, and to provide feedback on their research instruments, literature review and capstone proposals.\nMethodological foci: The “how to’s” of doing data-driven research projects in professional settings as well as the role of the researcher, rapport, and sampling design. We will also read relevant articles and case studies from experienced researchers. Students will then determine which methodology best addresses the issue(s) and/or problem they plan to study. Students will complete their IRB protocols, formalize their research questions, study objectives, and research instruments. All research instruments must be piloted before the end of the semester. During class, we will take up the questions and problems that emerge in doing empirical research including remote and in-person interviewing, leading questions, data recruitment, bias, validity, and reflexivity.

Organizational leaders and facilitators frequently lack an in-depth understanding of how work groups, multifunctional teams, and cross-national executive groups develop, operate, accomplish their goals--or not--and end. Team members often struggle to make meaning of the myriad spoken, as well as unexpressed, factors influencing the process and outcomes of the groups of which they are a part. This course, by emphasizing both theory and practice, provides students with a thorough grounding in the ways groups and teams develop and learn. The class will also examine approaches to building group and team competencies related to effective communication, conflict-resolution, and solving complex strategic problems as well as ways to manage the range of intentional and more hidden dynamics that both support and challenge high performance.  The course is designed to include seven 3-hour classroom meetings across the semester and two extended sessions that will afford students the opportunity to explore various theoretical frameworks. In addition to drawing on the extensive literature and research in group dynamics and team building, the class will rely on experiential methods to help students develop keener understanding and insight into the ways in which their own leadership and followership dynamics, as well as the dynamics of the group-as-a-whole, influence their team's ability to accomplish its tasks.

Worse, these behaviors are harming the public and the institutional trust with which our society must have in order to function. Whereas improper, illegal, and even immoral behavior on the part of business owners and operators is not new, the Internet and social media are bringing such acts into public scrutiny with both 24/7 coverage and worldwide attention. Reputations that took sometimes a century to build are lost in minutes, either never to be rebuilt or permanently damaged, harming customers, shareholders, employees, and suppliers in their wake. Individuals as well are subject to the same forces and dynamics of reputation and ethical behavioral lapses. Yet why do some companies and individuals rebound while others do not? Are common factors at work? Do they have a predictive quality in terms of other or all organizations? Crises are often blamed on bad PR, a poor crisis communications plan, or a less-than-credible spokesperson. If so, the company could just hire a slick PR firm, media-savvy advisor, or say a few mea culpas and move  on. Often what is at stake is a core failing--a breakdown in ethical behavior or problem-solving systems--that can't catch problems before they happen or when they do, tap into a network and a reservoir of employee goodwill, customer credibility, supplier loyalty, and stakeholder confidence. Still, even an ethically-guided, resilient organization that has all these assets will need help when a crisis hits. That's when solid and real-world based crisis communications take front and center stage. The course will both tease out how dysfunctional organizational dynamics can lead a company or organization down such a path and what options it took or should have taken to restore its reputation and what an ethical company can do when an event threatens to derail its reputation. It will examine the variables involved in crisis formation, communication once a crisis occurs, and management as it unfolds. In doing so we will consider the organization's vulnerabilities, the environment in which it thrives, the stakeholders who can influence its operation, and the strategies best suited to maintaining or enhancing its reputation. We will also examine the role of media in a crisis, as both a catalyst and intermediary in a communication strategy, and what to say and not say.

Why do we sometimes get our way, while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Over the past few decades, research in social psychology and decision science has sought the answer to this question and created a rich body of knowledge on bargaining behavior, leading to a well-validated prescription on how to negotiate. In this course, you will learn both the how and the why of negotiation behavior. Through role-playing exercises, you will be able to evaluate your own negotiation behavior as well as that of your classmates and receive advice on how to optimize it to achieve your desired outcomes.

We will critically examine an expansive literature touching on emotions, personality, media engagement, health communication, political communication, and more, all in the service of identifying notions of time that are often implicit in theories of human experience. In doing so, students will become accustomed to identifying and evaluating notions of change, accumulation, speed, timing, tempo, sequences, and applying the following questions to the topics they encounter in their everyday readings and their own research: What timescale(s) are addressed by a theory, either implicitly or explicitly? Is the timing of measurement matched to the timescale(s) over which phenomena are unfolding? Seminars will be accompanied by a data science laboratory in which students will gain hands-on experience in describing, visualizing, and analyzing intensive longitudinal data, data consisting of 5 or more repeated measures over relatively short (seconds, minutes, hours, days) timescales. Intensive longitudinal data are increasingly feasible to collect due to the widespread availability of smartphones and come with both data wrangling and analytic challenges as  well as opportunities to operationalize complex, time-related concepts.

Structure: An initial introductory lecture for the entire class is followed by 6 weekly small group sessions. These sessions are conducted as workshops designed to enhance student and faculty engagement to improve scientific writing. During the course, participants review the princinples of clear, persuasive writing, and apply these principles to writing for a scientific audience. Particular emphasis is placed on conveying the significance of your research, outlining your aims, and discussing your results. Classes are highly interactive, and the majority of class time will be spent discussing student scientific writing. In order to focus on the techniques of scientific writing, in-class discussion and critiques will not address scientific methodology or interpretations of results.

Slavery is the bedrock of this nations political and economic order, and, against all odds, the world the enslaved built became the basis of American arts and letters. Beginning with slavery and spanning the major historical and cultural developments in black lifei.e., Reconstruction, Harlem Renaissance, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, post-Civil Rights erawe will examine key literary texts that animate each period. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines textual and contextual analyses, we will read a variety of genres, from slave narratives to postmodern fiction, blues poems to Hip-Hop lyrics. While studying a range of literary conventions and cultural movements, we will pay close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past four centuries. We will ask: What constitutes the African American literary tradition? What are its recurring themes and motifs? What are its aesthetic and ethical commitments? How does this tradition enable us to understand one of the most powerful constructs of the modern worldrace? How do black authors represent race and its inextricable ties to other markers of identity like gender, sexuality, and class? And, ultimately, how does this tradition empower us to grapple with the fundamental questions of what it means to be human? As the late Toni Morrison put it in her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture: We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.

The 1930s was an era of masses – mass unemployment, mass movements, mass culture – when writers transformed the techniques of literary modernism to forever change the world. Their efforts to move readers from contemplation to resistance went beyond simply representing conditions on the ground, and their formal interventions were intended to advance political struggle. But this was not only a moment of the avant-garde, as the mass media of film, radio, and pulp magazines reached wider audiences than ever before. What’s a better place than a movie theater to pass the time when you’re out of a job? The period in American history we most associate with scarcity was also one of fantasy. In this course, we will seek to understand what people saw in the fleeting images of the silver screen and the ephemeral pages of little magazines.

Often considered the great literary genre of the Middle Ages, romance depicts erotic love, chivalric quests, and the unpredictability of adventure. Throughout this course, we speculate about the fall of romance, just as others theorize the rise of the novel. What is at stake in the decline of a premodern genre? Is romance declining after all? How do we understand the relationship of medieval romance to today’s literary fiction? The course begins with medieval romances such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Chaucer’s “The Knight’s Tale.” We then turn toward more recent bad romances, including Anne Carson’s Autobiography of Red and Patricia Highsmith’s The Price of Salt. The course investigates how the romance is racialized and gendered in poetry and music ranging from Danez Smith’s Homie to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance.” We will also discuss whether film adaptations, such as Carol and The Green Knight, are inherently bad. Other possible course readings and media include James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room, Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things, André Aciman’s Call Me By Your Name, Sally Rooney’s Beautiful World, Where Are You? and Sam Levinson’s Euphoria.\nThis course is designed to familiarize students with research methods and current scholarship in the field of literary studies.\n","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"AFRC-0012","title":"Study of an Author","description":"This course introduces students to literary study through the works of a major African American author. Reading an individual author across an entire career offers students the rare opportunity to examine works from several critical perspectives in a single course. How do our author's works help us to understand literary and cultural history? And how might we understand our author's legacy through performance, tributes, adaptations, or sequels? Exposing students to a range of approaches and assignments, this course is an ideal introduction to literary study. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nAs the recipient of numerous literary prizes (Nobel, Pulitzer, and National Book Critics Circle Award, to name a few), Toni Morrison (1932-2019) was an author of international renown whose books routinely occupied a place on best seller lists.  Indeed, it is safe to say that her work transcended what many readers ascertain as black writing in the 21st century.  This is not to say that such was Morrison's intent.  Her works consistently engaged the role memory, place, and community play in the lived experience of her characters, and by extensions her readers.  But given the fact that she eschewed the white gaze as a controlling motif in her fiction, how did Morrison seek to advance her literary project and to what end?  Could we characterize her project as being antiracist?  In a moment when the concept of value and how it attaches to human bodies remains a hotly contested topic in contemporary discourse, this survey course seeks to explore how reading Morrison's fiction and non-fiction can help readers to demystify and ultimately defy systems of Othering.  Moreover, considering Morrison's recent passing, what constitutes her legacy; how might we characterize her career at a time when social media has altered what it means to be a writer of influence?  Assignments in the course will include short critical essays, in-class projects, and work done in assigned groups.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nTo study the African American literary tradition is to have a front row view of the making of the American republic and indeed the modern world. Slavery is the bedrock of this nation’s political and economic order, and, against all odds, the world the enslaved built became the basis of American arts and letters. Beginning with slavery and spanning the major historical and cultural developments in black life—i.e., Reconstruction, Harlem Renaissance, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, post-Civil Rights era—we will examine key literary texts that animate each period. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines textual and contextual analyses, we will read a variety of genres, from slave narratives to postmodern fiction, blues poems to Hip-Hop lyrics. While studying a range of literary conventions and cultural movements, we will pay close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past four centuries. We will ask: What constitutes the African American literary tradition? What are its recurring themes and motifs? What are its aesthetic and ethical commitments? How does this tradition enable us to understand one of the most powerful constructs of the modern world—race? How do black authors represent race and its inextricable ties to other markers of identity like gender, sexuality, and class? And, ultimately, how does this tradition empower us to grapple with the fundamental questions of what it means to be human? As the late Toni Morrison put it in her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture: “We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.” Using the African American literary tradition, then, this course provides an occasion to contemplate the meaning and measure of life.

Long before true crime podcasts, Netflix documentaries, and TV channels like ID, early modern writers were telling salacious stories of adultery, witchcraft, murder, and betrayal which centered on the home. In a strange way, then, our contemporary fascination with these titillating tales joins our present moment and experiences of domesticity with those of the inhabitants of early modern England who similarly saw their homes as potential sites of secrecy and danger. By turning to literary representations of domesticity from the early modern period, this course aims to unsettle assumptions about the home as both private and secure, revealing these spaces to be more peculiar—and perhaps threatening—than they might at first appear. At the same time as we will be engaged with primary readings about the home that are sure to appear strange to us, we will also be engaging with archival materials and secondary, critical literature in order to further defamiliarize domesticity; as it happens, reading attentively and researching deeply are invaluable skills for uncovering the unfamiliar in the familiar. In order to hone these critical skills, we will ask such questions as these: What does the persecution of witches reveal about anxieties surrounding women’s work? What does it mean that mariticide (spouse-killing) was punished in the period as “petty treason?” And how did the intimate contact between women and servants afford opportunities for resistance to patriarchal and state power? As we attempt to answer these and similar questions, students will become familiar with the research skills and tools necessary in order to pursue research questions of their own. Assignments include several short (2-4 page) essays, an annotated bibliography, and a final research paper or creative project with a critical component.\n \nThis course is designed to familiarize students with research methods and current scholarship in the field of literary studies.\n","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"NURS-6020","title":"Nursing Profess Development","description":"This course provides nurses who are considering working in nursing professional development (NPD) in a variety of practice settings, an overview of the practice environment and roles of NPD practitioners.

Penns own Dr. Frances Jensen, neurologist and expert on the adolescent brain, tells us our decision-making capability doesnt go fully online until our mid-twenties. Its no accident, then, that youth stands as metaphor for irresponsibility, recklessness, resistance. But then, what about Resistance? Influence? Its a metaphor for those, too.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\"To study the African American literary tradition is to have a front row view of the making of the American republic and indeed the modern world. Slavery is the bedrock of this nation's political and economic order, and, against all odds, the world the enslaved built became the basis of American arts and letters. Beginning with slavery and spanning the major historical and cultural developments in black life i.e., Reconstruction, Harlem Renaissance, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, post-Civil Rights era, we will examine key literary texts that animate each period. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines textual and contextual analyses, we will read a variety of genres, from slave narratives to postmodern fiction, blues poems to Hip-Hop lyrics. While studying a range of literary conventions and cultural movements, we will pay close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past four centuries. We will ask: What constitutes the African American literary tradition? What are its recurring themes and motifs? What are its aesthetic and ethical commitments? How does this tradition enable us to understand one of the most powerful constructs of the modern world race? How do black authors represent race and its inextricable ties to other markers of identity like gender, sexuality, and class? And, ultimately, how does this tradition empower us to grapple with the fundamental questions of what it means to be human? As the late Toni Morrison put it in her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture: \"We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.\" Using the African American literary tradition, then, this course provides an occasion to contemplate the meaning and measure of life.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nThis is a wide-ranging introduction to the “other” major cinema in English: the films of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The British film industry has been thriving in the 21st century, but it remains the underdog in a global media environment dominated by Hollywood. We will consider some of the ways British filmmakers have positioned themselves in the space of world cinema and television as close rivals or radical alternatives to the American model. Our approach will be to study two films a week, mixing films from the 21st century with films from earlier moments in British cinema history from the 1930s through the 1990s. Our aim will be to discern some of the enduring cinematic modes and transatlantic strategies that contribute to the national “signature” of British film. Our screenings will run the gamut from the big-budget James Bond and Harry Potter franchise to mid-sized transnational productions such as Pride & Prejudice and Slumdog Millionaire, to more independent or artisanal work by such directors as Ken Loach, Mike Leigh, Sally Potter, Michael Winterbottom, Lynne Ramsay, and Andrea Arnold. A number of films we will study were made for British television, and we will devote some attention to the important and changing relationship between TV and cinema in contemporary screen culture.\nWritten work for the class will include four mid-term exams (no final), two 1-page research findings about the business side of the film industry, a 3-page formal analysis essay, and a research paper with various options, including a creative-writing option. Viewing every film at least once is required, but reading is relatively light. There are no prerequisites and no expectation that you have any expertise in British cinema or culture.

Exposing students to a range of approaches and assignments, this course is an ideal introduction to literary study. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nAs the recipient of numerous literary prizes (Nobel, Pulitzer, and National Book Critics Circle Award, to name a few), Toni Morrison (1932–2019) was an author of international renown whose books routinely occupied a place on bestseller lists. Indeed, it is safe to say that her work transcended what many readers ascertain as “black writing” in the 21st century. This is not to say that such was Morrison’s intent. Her works consistently engaged the role memory, place, and community play in the lived experience of her characters, and by extension, her readers. But given the fact that she eschewed the white gaze as a controlling motif in her fiction, how did Morrison seek to advance her literary project and to what end? Could we characterize her project as being antiracist? In a moment when the concept of value and how it attaches to human bodies remains a hotly contested topic in contemporary discourse, this survey course seeks to explore how reading Morrison’s fiction and non-fiction can help readers to demystify and ultimately defy systems of Othering. Moreover, considering Morrison’s recent passing, what constitutes her legacy; how might we characterize her career at a time when social media has altered what it means to be a writer of influence?

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nThe world of fiction today seems fairly neatly divided into novels and short stories. There was a time, though, when the novella had powerful claims as a preeminent literary genre. In the canon of high modernism and in the western literary marketplace 1880–1920, we find\nremarkable novellas by Herman Melville, Leo Tolstoy, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield, Kate Chopin, William Faulkner, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, Edith Wharton, and many others. The goal of this seminar is to study these landmark\ntexts, asking what is distinctive about fiction that exceeds the scope of the story or shrinks the scale of the novel. Is there a “theory of the novella” that explains the specific social and symbolic aims of the genre? To pursue our inquiry, we’ll consult several critical essays on this\ntopic. And to extend our body of evidence into more contemporary and non-western writing, we’ll also consider novellas by Truman Capote, Toni Morrison, Ghassan Kanafani, Cynthia Ozick, Octavia Butler, N.K. Jemisin, Carmen Maria Machado, Gabriel García-Márquez, Lu Xun, Helen DeWitt, Vivek Shanbhag, and Mishima Yukio.\nSince this is a Benjamin Franklin Seminar, the pace of reading will be brisk: 1-2 novellas per week.

The British film industry has been thriving in the 21st century, but it remains the underdog in a global media environment dominated by Hollywood. We will consider some of the ways British filmmakers have positioned themselves in the space of world cinema and television as close rivals or radical alternatives to the American model. Our approach will be to study two films a week, mixing films from the 21st century with films from earlier moments in British cinema history from the 1930s through the 1990s. Our aim will be to discern some of the enduring cinematic modes and transatlantic strategies that contribute to the national \"signature\" of British film. Our screenings will run the gamut from the big-budget James Bond and Harry Potter franchise to mid-sized transnational productions such as Pride & Prejudice and Slumdog Millionaire, to more independent or artisanal work by such directors as Ken Loach, Mike Leigh, Sally Potter, Michael Winterbottom, Lynne Ramsay, and Andrea Arnold. A number of films we will study were made for British television, and we will devote some attention to the important and changing relationship between TV and cinema in contemporary screen culture. Written work for the class will include four mid-term exams (no final), two 1-page research findings about the business side of the film industry, a 3-page formal analysis essay, and a research paper with various options, including a creative-writing option. Viewing every film at least once is required, but reading is relatively light. There are no prerequisites and no expectation that you have any expertise in British cinema or culture.

Victorian poets experimented with new and old verse forms to frame unresolved questions about the meaning of scientific discoveries (geological change, evolution, the inevitable end of planetary life) and about social hierarchies and political struggles, from the class system to empire and race to gender and sexual norms, and they wrote for popular audiences far larger than we can now imagine poetry addressing.

In the last few years we have seen tremendous progress in this interdisciplinary area where fundamentals of systems theory, computation and optimization interact. For example, methods have emerged to handle hybrid systems, i.e. systems comprising both continuous and discrete components.

The first section introduces the student to major debates about the so-called gunpowder empires of the Islamic world as well as to comparative approaches to study them. The second section focuses on the transformations of modes of warfare and military organization. The third section considers the cultural history and artistic production of the imperial courts of the Ottomans, the Mughals, and the Safavids.

How effective have historians been—or can they be—in countering egregious ‘myths’ about the past, in uncovering ‘silences’ in the historical record, and in acknowledging that the same ‘objective’ events can leave different memories and carry different meanings for the various parties involved.   Does fuller knowledge of the past constrain or empower our capacities to deal with challenges in the present and future?\nIn examining these and other ‘meta-questions’ through a series of specific case studies, you will almost certainly learn something about contested histories in parts of the world you may not be familiar with, but which should help you situate your own regional interests in a wider comparative framework.

And each imperial court, those of the Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Mughals, found innovative and original forms of expression in art and literature. The expansion of these Islamic empires, each of them military giants and behemoths of bureaucracy, marked a new phase in world history.  The course is divided in four sections. The first section introduces the student to major debates about the so-called gunpowder empires of the Islamic world as well as to comparative approaches to study them. The second section focuses on the transformations of modes of warfare and military organization. The third section considers the cultural history and artistic production of the imperial courts of the Ottomans, the Mughals, and the Safavids.

The overall goal of the course is to explore how private parties could order their commercial interactions, to develop a theory of how they ought to do this, and to gain a thorough understanding of how business deals are actually done. The course is offered in springtime terms only. The long first half of the course is devoted to analyzing impediments to transacting, including asymmetric information, exogenous risk and uncertainty, difficulties intrinsic to contracting over time, enforceability, and various forms of strategic behavior, all with a view to understanding the logic of the variety of techniques used to ameliorate them and more broadly to create distributable value through transaction structuring. These Part I classes are accompanied by exercises of various sorts. In the second part of the course, student teams apply the conceptual tools and techniques developed in the first half to analyzing the fine detail of a series of recently completed and interestingly complex transactions. Each team is given access to the original documents implementing their deal. A week of class time is devoted to each transaction. In the first (Monday) session, the student teams present their deal to the class, laying out strategic motivations, analyzing key structuring moves, and exploring the advantages and disadvantages of proceeding in the way the participants did. In the second, on the Wednesday, one or (usually) more of the professionals who worked on it will present the deal from the participant perspective, address the always interesting process questions, and take questions from the class. The requirements for the class are regular attendance, active participation in class discussions, a series of homework assignments and a short individual paper in Part I, the group presentation project and a group memorandum from each deal team on what there was to be learned from the Wednesday presentation their week in Part II, and a six-hour take-home exam.\nWharton MBA Course.

However, executives, board members, and investment managers are actually growing less confident in the ESG data available to guide capital allocations and strategic decisions.

For this course, social entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship used to profitably confront social problems.

The basic thesis is that many social problems, if looked at through an entrepreneurial lens, create opportunity for someone to launch a venture that generates profits by alleviating that social problem. This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing, the more the profits made, the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise, the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity.

These assignments will provide students with an opportunity to try different modes of expression that engage voice and voicing (such as podcasts, audiobooks, radio drama, voice acting, voice overs, and broadcasting) to gradually develop a non-text-based final project. In so doing, we center voice work as a method to explore the resources and power within us to overcome “stage fright” or the fear of our own voice.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ANTH-1430","title":"Explorations in Human Biology","description":"This course is an exploration of human biology from a biocultural and evolutionary perspective.

Among the subjects to be explored are sex determination, the nature of orgasms, and the sexual development of females and males from birth to adulthood. The role of ecology and social life in shaping human mating patterns is also evaluated using ethnographic and cross-cultural materials from a variety of human cultures. In particular, the course examines why humans marry or pair bond, whether there is a biological basis of love, which biological and psychological factors produce jealousy. Finally, the course explores topics relevant to human sexuality today, such as the \"hook-up culture\", contraception and abortion, sex work, sexual transmitted diseases, and the ethical and legal dimensions of human sexuality.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ANTH-1230","title":"Communication & Culture","description":"The course looks at varieties of human expression -- such as art, film, language and song -- as communicative practices that connect persons together to form a common culture.

The boom in interest in the Italian Renaissance in the late 20th and 21st century reconceptualizes the relationship between spectator and cultural artifact.  The works of the Renaissance have become symbols in and of themselves— but the question remains, symbols of what? It is within this context that new media have begun to change how the Renaissance is mythologized, perceived, experienced and appreciated. Throughout the course we will examine different examples of contemporary adaptations of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael in cinema, photography, and digital installation. These varied case studies, in their respective mediums, invite us to ponder the difference between kitsch and art. In this cross-disciplinary course we will tackle issues such as posterity, spectatorship, intermediality and adaptation with the goal of determining whether this trend of refashioning the Renaissance is one that will survive the moment in an enduring and enlightening way.

Why do we read Dante almost seven hundred years after his death? We will, therefore, read the Commedia as Dante’s legacy, in relation to its historical and cultural context, and as a seminal text in world literature.

In the former case, we will focus on methodological issues of authoriality, narrativity, and materiality; in the latter, on mediality, theatricality, and gender. Other case studies may be considered according to students’ interests. In addition, we will discuss historiographical and theoretical notions of “Baroque,” early modernity, postmodernity, performativity, reenactment, and the postdramatic. No Italian or musical notation knowledge is required; however, we will investigate early seventeenth-century Italy's literary and performance culture, and music-analytical approaches will be discussed if interest arises. Students in Music Studies and Composition are welcome, as well as those in Francophone, Italian, and Germanic Studies, the Program in Comparative Literature & Literary Theory, and those interested in early modernity and performance studies in general. For scheduling reasons, decisions regarding enrollment in this seminar must be finalized no later than the day after the first meeting (on 1/14).

The canonical model in economics views an agent as a fully rational, atomistic individual making optimal choices under scarcity. This approach has been very powerful theoretically and empirically to explain and to predict behavior in the workplace. This model has also been enriched to accommodate other phenomena arguably affecting behavior in the workplace like the social context (e.g. peer effects, altruism, or social comparison), non-standard time preferences, loss aversion, and cognitive costs. Incorporating these ideas into the standard model can be accomplished in various ways but the real stress test for these theories is whether they predict behavior more generally (i.e. we don't just use theory to explain one choice but choices more generally) and to generate empirical predictions that can be tested using experiments. In this mini-course we start-off with a tour de force of the fundamental principal-agent model and the various behavioral extensions. The core of the course is, however, not theoretical but a practical course on how to design field experiments to test these ideas.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"MGMT-9700","title":"Research Methods in Mgmt","description":"Students taking the course will be introduced to the seminal readings on a given method, have a hands-on discussion regarding their application often using a paper and dataset of the faculty member leading the discussion.

In this course, we won't answer these questions ourselves but will rely upon the methods of history, sociology, and anthropology to explore the world of the sport scientists who do. Sport scientists produce knowledge about how human bodies work and the intricacies of human performance. They bring elite (world-class) athletes to their laboratories-or their labs to the athletes. Through readings, discussions, and original research, we will find out how these scientists determine the boundary between \"natural\" and \"performance-enhanced,\" work to conquer the problem of fatigue, and establish the limits and potential of human beings.

We also discuss approaches and methodological questions in general history and general philosophy. We start with Karl Marx, arguably the most influential historian and philosopher of technology of the modern era, and discuss him in relation to what has been one of the most visible debates in the historiography of technology - the question of technological determinism. We then travel in a roughly chronological order through key periods and methodological issues in the fields. During our journey we encounter the Middle Ages and historical theoreticians of the Annales School, the early modern period and questions about gender and microhistory, and the so-called Industrial Revolution and the questions it raises about what's modern about modern technology. Mid- way through the class, we discuss two classics in the philosophy of technology, Martin Heidegger and Ju?rgen Habermas, who grapple precisely with the question about the modern element in industrial technology.  As we enter the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, we expand our methodological horizon to include examples from the cultural history of technology and applications of the social constructivism debate to the history of technology. We end the class with works on the recently emerging fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology and with a set of monographs written in the nascent sub-discipline in the history and philosophy of technology, engineering studies.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.327,"instructor_quality":3.558,"difficulty":2.575,"work_required":2.683,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"HSOC-4324","title":"Med Activ & Pol Health","description":"During the second half of the twentieth century, overlapping waves of social reform movements agitating for civil rights, women's rights, peace, environmentalism, and gay rights reshaped the U.S. political and cultural landscape.

Since these early beginnings in European imperialism, the social sciences have sought to represent, alter, and govern human existence while struggling to define \"society\" as something separate from \"nature\". This class examines how questions concerning the proper management of self and society are central to the ambitions and dilemmas of modern social sciences. We begin by tracing the origins of social science in late-eighteenth century thought and their professionalization in the nineteenth century. Continuing through to the twentieth century, we will observe how core social science disciplines like sociology, anthropology, and psychology attempted - in the name of anti-racism - to carve out distinct niches in opposition to biology and genetics. The course also examines the dramatic growth of the social sciences during the cold war period thanks to military funds. Our examination of cold war social science will focus on how social scientists began carving up the world into different \"areas\" of study and how they became increasingly oriented towards re-making individual psyches and societies in the \"third world\" to fit the image of an industrialized \"West\".

Additionally, the incorporation of new technologies into the military sphere, whether or not they started as civilian technologies, fundamentally changed the ways in which war was conceptualized, fought, and won. But the significance of medicine and technology in a military context extends well beyond the injuries and illnesses of war. Looking more closely at the ways in which physicians, military officers, soldiers, and civilians have interacted with each other both in war and in peace reveals much about the political, cultural, and disciplinary formation of medicine in the modern era and the roles technology in such formations. Understanding historical uses of medicine and technologies sheds light upon notions of localized and globalized warfare, as well as the political machinations in which nations engaged to create ideologies of dominance, threat, and safety.\nThis seminar surveys the history of medicine and technology, principally in an American context, from the seventeenth through the late twentieth centuries.

The last several decades in social science have seen remarkable breakthroughs in our answers to these and other profound questions about societal communication and evolution. One of the most powerful and influential tools behind these breakthroughs is computational modeling. Models are used to simulate the spread COVID, and to test strategies for halting the pandemic. They are used to test strategies for international relations, and to predict the emergence of new terrorist cells. Models are also used to predict voting outcomes and create better forms of political representation. This class does not involve coding and no programming experience is necessary.

But nobody doubts that the policy significantly altered the nation's demography, or that most of today's Chinese young adults face a \"4-2-1\" family structure. While the norm of filial piety remains strong, almost sacred, the PRC's government leaders and ministers, and average Chinese citizens, have recognized that relying on children as the primary caregivers for elders in Chinese society is highly desirable but simply no longer as feasible as it once was. In the class-wide capstone, students will explore the following topics: Does China's burgeoning elderly population pose a serious problem and constitute a major threat to human well-being? What role have various Chinese institutions--families, community/neighborhood associations, NGOs, businesses, and governance bodies--played in addressing the nation's elder care challenges?

We will trace the development of Sufism as a form of Muslim piety linked to key notions in the Quran as well as living practices of venerating the Prophet Muhammad. We will then immerse ourselves in Sufi theoretical writings through a select list of primary sources introducing foundational Sufi concepts concerning the annihilation of oneself in God, and the various stages of the Sufi quest for spiritual union.

But global progress in improving human well-being has been neither linear nor universal. For instance, measured at living on just $5.50 a day per person, nearly 3.5 billion people still live in extreme poverty. Moreover, humankind now faces several unprecedented existential threats to human life itself such as global warming and the persistence or spread of drug-resistant infectious diseases including ones once thought to be nearly eradicated. In this course, students are introduced to multiple and competing concepts and empirical theories on each of two interrelated questions regarding global leadership and problem-solving: (1) What, if any, particular approaches (for example, \"collaborative governance\" or \"boundary-spanning leadership\") might predictably and reliably increase the odds that the next century-long chapter in the annals of global human well-being--the chapter to be written between now and the decade that will begin in 2120--will be a tale of greater wealth, health, and happiness for all or most people worldwide? (2) Under what, if any, conditions can diverse institutions--families and social networks; neighborhood and community groups; nonprofit or social sector organizations; for-profit firms; and local, national, and transnational government institutions--act, either independently or in tandem with each other, to maintain or improve human well-being? Each student quasi-independently researches and writes a capstone research paper describing, analyzing, and assessing an existing policy or program pertaining to one of the following three challenges: elder care with a focus on China; education with a focus on Africa; or economic development with a focus on Latin America.\nCourse offered by Penn LPS Online.

We will discuss whether specific and distinctive explanations  of these four phenomena are appropriate, or whether general explanations are available—and satisfying. Historic cases of unifications will be considered, e.g., German and Italian unifications  in the nineteenth-century, pairing them with some failed pan-movements, as well as more recent cases of unification (e.g., Germany), failed reunifications (e.g. Cyprus),  and possible future reunifications (Ireland and Korea). General literature on annexation in international law, international relations and comparative politics will be examined. Have there been any decisive trends in annexations? Are these being reversed? Creeping as well as wholesale annexations will be considered. Case studies  will include Chinese, American, Russian, Turkish, and Israeli annexations. We will ask  why governments choose not to annex territories they control.

Lectures will provide students with an introduction to and understanding of the primary components of a number of federal environmental statutes, including: Clean Air Act; Clean Water Act; CERCLA; NEPA; EPCRA; RCRA; and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The interplay between federal and state environmental laws and requirements will also be discussed.  A recurring theme will be the role that the environmental professional plays as part of the interaction between governmental regulators and members of the regulated community.  Case studies will be presented to address the practical implications that environmental legal requirements have on the regulated community.  The class will explore current topics, such as climate change regulation; federalism issues; regulation of e-waste; safe drinking water issues, and the jurisdiction of federal clean water protection efforts.

The course develops the concept of Risk Assessment from the publication of the 1983 National Research Council (NRC) report commonly known as the \"Red Book\" which was used to rank the initial hazardous waste sites under the Superfund program. Using a variety of teaching tools, including lectures, panel discussions, and case studies, the course examines how public policy decisions regarding environmental risk are made and how effective those decisions are at reducing risks to affected populations. The course focuses on the complex interaction of science, economics, politics, laws, and regulations in dealing with environmental and public health risks. The course will begin with a review of the policy process and methods used in evaluating human health and environmental risks, including the traditional steps in the risk assessment process, including quantitative and qualitative aspects of hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.  The course will then focus on how scientific uncertainty, risk perceptions, socio-economic disparities, risk communication, and politics influence environmental risk-based decision-making. Issues such as special populations (e.g., children, elderly, immune-compromised, woman of pregnancy age, etc.) must be considered when developing risk reduction strategies. The use of the \"precautionary principle\" will be discussed in the context of different types of environmental stressors (e.g., pesticides, chemicals, climate change, air pollution, water quality, and land use) and how this important controversial principle is applied differently in contrasting national and European risk management policies.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"CHIN-0410","title":"Intensive Inter Chinese I & II","description":"Along with Intensive Beginning Chinese I & II, this is the second course of a two-semester sequence.

Although the number of people executed during the witch-hunts is a matter of scholarly debate, their importance in understanding early modern beliefs and responses to social tensions is clear. In this class, we will explore historians' understandings of the causes underlying this cultural phenomenon. With special attention to gender, social position, and religious belief, we will join academic debates about the causes of these persecutions. We will also read some primary sources from the medieval through the early modern periods, including trial transcripts, sermons, and pamphlets. Were women the main target of witchcraft accusations and executions, and if so, was misogyny their most important cause? What role did sexual norms and beliefs have in the way that accusations were framed? Were there different patterns of accusations and executions across time and region, and if so, what social and cultural factors might explain them? In what ways were witchcraft accusations an effort to  control marginal people in local communities, particularly in regard to gender, socio-economic position, and age? How might religious developments and conflicts have influenced elite and popular ideas about witchcraft? What challenges do historians face in analyzing primary sources about witchcraft and witchcraft trials?

But, at the dawn of the new millennium, leading businesses began to change their concept of environmental management to look beyond simply meeting governmental dictates. These organizations began to evolve and utilize \"environmental strategy\" to create new ways of growing their businesses by bringing sustainability to the core of their business strategies. This seismic shift in view was accompanied by a bottom line emphasis that, in some cases, turned sustainability efforts into profit centers. Sustainability increasingly is not hidden within the silo of environmental, health, and safety departments but has become much more seamlessly integrated into the operations of corporate functional disciplines.  Today, to effectively work in senior management, an executive needs to be knowledgeable not only about his or her specific business function but also how his or her business will be impacted by governmental regulations, policies, corporate sustainability initiatives, green marketing regulations, industry guidelines or 'best practices', new sustainable technologies, energy planning, environmental performance metrics, and required reporting on the environmental impact of their business unit.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"HCMG-8980","title":"Global Modular Course","description":"Global Modular Course (GMC) - see description in section details\nAs one of the world’s fastest growing regions, West Africa is quickly evolving. Central to this growth story is Ghana, often considered a key regional economic and political leader. Over the past four decades, Ghana has leveraged progress in key industries (cocoa, gold, oil) and the emergence of stable democratic governance to transition from near economic collapse to rapid growth. Increasing trade and investment opportunities in Ghana have important implications for its economic and social development and could have ripple effects across the region. Through a series of site visits in the capital Accra and the cultural center Kumasi, students will gain on-the-ground knowledge of Ghana’s key industries, core democratic institutions and its public and private health sectors. This course will examine the arc of Ghana’s social and economic experience – from its political history and cultural traditions to the emergence of a local entrepreneurship and innovation landscape set to drive progress in future decades. Through meetings with high-level leaders from Ghana’s political, business, and health sectors, students will gain an appreciation for the country’s position in the 21st century economy, as well as the unique challenges it faces for the road ahead.

Horace Walpole’s Otranto, Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey, Charlotte Bronte's Thornfield.  Here are the walls containing the skeletons and the secrets, the pervasive sense of impending danger and inevitable tragedy that exemplify the classic Gothic work. But what if I were to add Taylor Swift’s “Evermore”? Or Jordan Peele’s Get Out? Or a good quarter of TikTok? What say you to that?\n\nThe fact is that the Gothic aesthetic, with its imperiled protagonist and angsty atmosphere, goes backwards and forwards over centuries, overflowing with haunted hallways, dastardly villains, draining hourglasses—entrancing stand-ins for the horrors that lurk in our own psyches. In this course, we will study classic and contemporary Gothic texts and media, along with supplemental commentary, to determine what exactly “Gothic\" means. Where the present day fits into the equation. And why, as a fuzzily-boundaried genre, the Gothic has been unflaggingly best-selling, lauded and derided in equal measure, for nearly three hundred years.\n\nThere will be lots of reading, some critical writing, and multiple opportunities to go outside-the-box in both answering the questions above and deciding what the Gothic will be for the remainder of our century.

Some of the changes in consumer behavior directly affected luxury in the short-term, but these changes in behavior may eventually revert to past history when the pandemic is over. Examples of these include the drop in tourism travel, work from home trends, reduced traffic to physical retail and malls, and the reduction of festive social activities (e.g., weddings). Other trends affected many industries and are likely to fundamentally change consumer behavior long-term: (1) net zero retail now, (2) digital by design, (3) thoughtful experience, (4) re-localization and (5) lead with purpose.\nThis course explores the special challenges that are faced by luxury brands as they try to navigate rapidly evolving shopping behaviors in both the online and offline environments. In this course we will articulate the key principles for successful luxury branding & experiences and focus on the challenges and opportunities that luxury brands face.\nAlthough we will have some traditional lecture/discussion classes, the course is primarily experiential. We will explore  luxury broadly across many product categories.

The success of high-profile firms with \"quirky cultures\" such as Southwest Airlines and the entrepreneurial cultures of high tech firms that, along with the rise of interest in companies that have created \"Great Places to Work\", with associated awards programs have generated recognition that organizational culture can be a major factor contributing to organizational performance. The related emergence of \"high performance organizations,\" acknowledgment that organization culture can trump the implementation of organizational strategy, competition among companies to attract the best employees, and the failure of many financially promising mergers and acquisitions all pointed to the importance of understanding and intentionally managing organizational culture. More recently, events related to the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter have focused our attention on the degree to which all members of an organization are welcomed, respected, valued and heard along with having an equal opportunity to succeed on the merits of their performance rather than be judged on their identity. The renewed awareness has called long overdue attention to the  fact that life within many organizations has been deeply inequitable. This course will address how organizations can change deep rooted cultures that favor some groups over others when those who most need to change and who control the changes that will be made are benefitting from the culture the way it is. We will also consider the relationship that formal policies and informal practices have on reinforcing or shifting cultures as well as the daily form of interactions among organization members that may be ignored. We will discuss what is meant by having an \"inclusive\" culture and how organizations can become more inclusive and equitable. Only when inequities are effectively addressed can an organization achieve high performance that is sustainable over time. Organizational cultures change for better or worse when an organization is faced with a crisis. COVID19 has had a substantial impact on many organizations. The response of each organization's leaders has either reinforced the culture of the organization or revealed underlying values different from those that have been espoused. We will examine how leaders' behaviors in a crisis support or change culture. This course also will address many of the major debates about organizational culture as well as provide students with tools for better assessing and  understanding organizational culture, and leading and managing culture change. Course material and discussions will consistently address issues related to both theory and practice with particular attention to how these apply to current issues impacting organizations.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which utilizes secularized practices from Asian and South Asian traditions for the remediation of various health concerns, has revolutionized behavioral medicine, and the scientific evaluation of MBSR has shed new light on the biomechanical pathways linking mind and body. This course will 1) explore fundamental principles underlying mindfulness, 2) the scientific data on its effects, and 3) the ways in which mindfulness is being applied to clinical and educational settings to support healthy human development. Contemplative practices include all forms of meditation, including contemplative dimensions of yoga, tai chi, qigong and other mind-body wellness activities. By far the most well known contemplative practice in the U.S. today is \"mindfulness.\" Mindfulness meditation was introduced into clinical medicine in the 1980's in the form of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn and his colleagues at U Mass; since that time it has had a significant impact on psychoneuroimmunology, clinical medicine, and especially behavioral medicine. Both psychological theory and practice have slowly been transformed by new findings emerging from mindfulness research. Brain imaging studies of persons engaged in meditation suggest that focused mental activities can actually change cerebral blood flow (Newberg et al 2010), brain morphology and neural circuitry, in addition to strengthening the immune system (Davidson et al 2003) and improving attention skills (Jha et al 2007). MBSR has been repeatedly documented to be effective in treating mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, in numerous adult populations (Goyal et al 2014).

Local, national, and international incidents -- including those caused by natural disasters, human behavior, infrastructure failures, and acts of terror -- can pose serious threats to the health and wellness of individuals and cohort groups of community members and to the normative functioning of institutional entities. These conditions, also, within the heightened immediacy of globally interconnected electronic communications modalities, must be optimally ameliorated under compressed time pressures amidst highly volatile circumstances that can be peopled with disaffected and/or seditious stakeholders.\n\nIn response to these potential threats, many entities, institutions, and educational systems have pro-actively developed strategic risk-remediation and crisis response frameworks that they attempt to implement consistently, effectively, and efficiently to maintain mission-critical functions and to restore institutional stasis after a disruption. Leaders who most consistently foment institutional resilience are those who are: (a) strategically nimble, decisive, purposeful, and optimistic; and, therefore (b) most adept at meeting the vagaries of institutional crises using critical incident response and recovery models that are optimally crafted to use the strengths of their individual and leadership team’s styles and institutional culture.\n\nThe core goal of the Modeling Resilient Leadership through Crisis, Calamity, Calumny, and Catastrophe course is to acquaint students with categories of crises endemic to institutions, agencies, and systems; to help them understand the importance of crisis mitigation advance planning including the elements of a crisis management plan and the value of “tabletop” practice; to increase their knowledge of how leadership styles and characteristics contribute to leadership resilience through institutional crises, and to survey institutional crisis response variables including: threat and vulnerability analysis, crisis communications, stakeholders, and audiences.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"EDUC-8681","title":"Classes & Latent Mixture Modls","description":"Multivariate strategies for prediction of binary, ordered and categorical outcomes and for classification accuracy and hypothesis testing; finite mixture modeling for discovery, validity and explanation of latent subgroups of profiles and change trajectories.

They are instruments with which we view, interpret, and give meaning to data. In this course, students will be exposed to and do work in all phases of the modeling life-cycle, including model design and specification, model construction (including data gathering and testing), extraction of information from models during post-solution analysis, and creation of studies that use modeling results to support conclusions for scientific or decision making purposes. In addition, the course will cover critical assessments of fielded models and studies using them. The course will focus broadly on models pertaining to energy and sustainability. This is not only an inherently interesting and important area, but it is very much a public one. In consequence, models, data, and studies using them are publicly and profusely available, as is excellent journalism, which facilitates introductions to specific topics. The course covers selected topics in energy and sustainability. Essential background will be presented as needed, but the course is not a comprehensive overview of energy and sustainability. Modeling in the area of energy and sustainability analytics is rife with uncertainty, and yet decisions must be made. Uncertainty, and how to deal with it in model-based decision making, is an overarching theme of the course. We will focus on energy and sustainability, but that area is hardly unique in being beset with deep and vexing uncertainties. The lessons we learn will generalize.

It is an interdisciplinary field consisting of researchers who study among other things, cognition, science and math education, language literacy, anthropological and sociological perspectives, computer science, and educational psychology. Learning scientists study learning as it happens in real world contexts and design resources and environments to improve learning in those contexts. This can happen in school, in informal places, at work, and online. Although the learning sciences is continually evolving, what remains true of the tenets of this educational field is that learning happens through mediated processes that most often require collaboration with others whereby learning is inextricably linked to context and culture.

Encounters with an artwork - much like our encounters with another - may catalyze connection and become a wellspring for healing and shared joy to unexpectedly emerge. This course, offered in collaboration with the Barnes Foundation and Public Trust, will explore how art can foster a mutuality of healing and compassion for one another and ourselves, with a specific focus on caregiving and medicine today. Each week, students will be invited to reflect on the way in which the arts, artists, and arts institutions can better support those who suffer, as well as the role of the arts and humanities more generally in helping patient and caregiving communities create intentional space to spur introspection and externalize inner grief and private suffering. The course will meet weekly in the permanent collection of the Barnes Foundation and at Public Trust on Penn's campus, where students will directly engage with a variety of artists, artistic practices, and museum professionals.

By 1850, the United States sent a greater fraction of its children to school than any other nation on earth. Why? What did young people learn there? And, most of all, how did these institutions both reflect and shape our evolving conceptions of \"America\" itself? In an irreducibly diverse society, the answers were never simple. Americans have always defined their nation in a myriad of contrasting and often contradictory ways. So they have also clashed vehemently over their schools, which remain our central public vehicle for deliberating and disseminating the values that we wish to transmit to our young. Our course will pay close attention to these education-related debates, especially in the realms of race, class, and religion. When immigrants came here from other shores, would they have to relinquish their old cultures and languages? When African-Americans won their freedom from bondage, what status would they assume? And as different religious denominations fanned out across the country, how would they balance the uncompromising demands of faith with the pluralistic imperatives of democracy? All of these questions came into relief at school, where the answers changed dramatically over time. Early American teachers blithely assumed that newcomers would abandon their old-world habits and tongues; today, \"multicultural education\" seeks to preserve or even to celebrate these distinctive patterns.

The course intends to improve the ability of engineers and other technology disciplines to gain more support more quickly for projects, researc product and services development, and marketing. For those wanting to be entrepreneurs o r intrapreneurs, the course is designed essentially to find the most value possible in starting up and running companies. Based on Professor Diamond's innovative and renowned model of negotiation, it is intended to assist those for whom technical expertise is not enough to persuade others, internally and externally, to provide resources, promotions and project approvals; or to resolve disputes, solve problems and gain more opportunities. Rejecting the 40-year-old notions of power, leverage and logic, the course focuses on persuasion by making better human connections, uncovering perceptions and emotions, and structuring agreements to be both collaborative and fair. This course is entrepreneurial in nature and can provide many times more value than traditional persuasion.

Our readings, from Jewish American Literature: A Norton Anthology, will include a variety of stellar authors, both famous and less-known, including Isaac Mayer Wise, Emma Lazarus, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Celia Dropkin, Abraham Cahan, Anzia Yezierska, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Cynthia Ozick, and Allegra Goodman. Students will come away from this course having explored the ways that Jewish culture intertwines with American culture in literature.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":2.686,"instructor_quality":2.833,"difficulty":1.953,"work_required":1.956,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"NELC-1700","title":"Intro to Persian Poetry","description":"This course introduces some of the major genres and themes of the millennium-old Persian poetic tradition from ancient to modern Iran.

This course will teach students how to think about sports as ritual that brings people together, divides them, and gives athletes the power to remake themselves through the way they use and talk about their bodies. We will first look at the ceremonial and ritual aspects of sports from the view of the spectator or fan, considering the question of whether sports teams are totems-- symbols of greater entities that communities gather around for identity and unity. Then we will look at the ritual aspect of sport from the viewpoint of the athlete, considering the ways that athletes use their bodies in sports to foster community and even spirituality. There will be a secondary focus on raising ethical questions through a discussion of case studies based on real events. Issues of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, age and disability will be prominently featured. There will be guest speakers- athletic and academic and at least one class visit to a sporting event.

Over 90% of new products introduced into the marketplace fail. A good portion of these failures are due to lack of understanding of end consumers and their needs. To develop truly successful new products, it's not enough just to ask people what they need or want. Designers and engineers need tools and techniques to get beyond what people can explicitly state and determine their implicit needs. Needfinding is an approach for developing deep insights that provide strategic direction for corporations and open up new possibilities for product development. In this class students will gain a toolset from which to develop their own approaches to conducting researching for design: learning how to think about other people, about culture, and about new perspectives. They will also learn tactical skills: how to define research questions, how to conduct observations and interviews, how to interpret results, how to synthesize them into fodder for design, and how to communicate their findings in a way that is compelling and actionable for designers, marketers, and business strategists.

They have conceived of creation myths and of origins stories for their communities in order to position themselves within the past and present of the natural and human worlds. The newly Christianized kingdoms of Medieval Europe faced the challenge of securing a place in the new vision of universal Providential history, and they inscribed their own histories into the narratives they knew from the authoritative sources of the time - biblical genealogies and heroic stories inherited from the poets of classical antiquity. The deeds and virtues of saintly kings and church hierarchs provided a continuity of historical narrative on the sacred map of time and space. In the 19th century, while interest in medieval antiquity as a source of inspiration for political and cultural renewal brought about a critical study of evidence, it also effected reinterpretation and repurposing of this evidence vis-a-vis a new political concept - that of a nation.

Every culture has its own way of representing the unknown and sublimating its deep-seated fears of contamination and invasion; often through the figure of the monster. In this course we will study films featuring a wide assortment of monsters and the gothic and science fiction literature that inspires and reproduces them across a range of genres, cultures, and time periods. Films may include: Nosferatu, Frankenstein, The Fly, 28 Weeks Later, King Kong, Freaks, Alien, and Godzilla. Authors may include: Mary Shelley, Horace Walpole, William Beckford, and Octavia Butler. This course includes an introduction to film analysis and readings in cultural studies and literary theory. There are no prerequisites.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"COML-0303","title":"National Epics","description":"In this course we will consider texts that become \"national epics,\" texts that in some sense come to \"represent\" a nation.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nThe twentieth century saw the rise and refinement of commercial sound recording, which gave rise to a proliferation of sound-based artistry. This course will examine how music and poetry influenced each other throughout the century. We’ll listen to blues and jazz poems alongside their namesakes, look at the influence of the Dadaists and Italian Futurists on the New Wave music of the 1980s, and discuss various songs modeled on poems and vice versa. Along the way, we will listen to other key recordings that overlap with the poetry and music: sound art, sermon recordings, political radio speeches, and comedy monologues, for example. Our aim will be to trace a series of intersecting aesthetic lineages that lead into the current day. Key works will include poems by T.S. Eliot, James Weldon Johnson, Gertrude Stein, Adrienne Rich, Amiri Baraka, Sylvia Plath, Charles Bernstein, the Russian and Italian Futurists, Dadaists, and the Beats. We’ll encounter many genres of music, including: Tin Pan Alley musicals, ragtime, blues, doo wop, reggae, punk, pop, hip-hop, and more.

Using these tools, students will develop their abilities in oral and written communication throughout the semester, establishing a firm foundation for further study of the language. Students with research, professional, or personal interests in Haiti or the Haitian Diaspora are encouraged to enroll. Haitian Creole is spoken by over 12 million people around the world (including many in cities across the Eastern seaboard) and serves as a wholly developed language with a complete orthography capable of fulfilling the full range of expressive and communicative needs of its speakers. It is also a language with a relatively recent history, dating back to the French colonization of Haiti (then called \"Saint-Domingue\") in 1697, and has thus been shaped by the same cultural and social forces that define Haiti's situation today. Students should, therefore, expect our immersive study of Haitian Creole to extend to historical examination of the economic, political, sociological, and spiritual  spheres within which the language was borne. This course is intended for students with no past exposure to Haitian Creole. While prior experience with French, the language from which Haitian Creole derives most of its lexicon, may be advantageous, it is neither assumed nor preferred.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"QUEC-0100","title":"Elementary Quechua I","description":"Quechua, the language of the Inca Empire and still spoken by approximately 6 million people throughout the Andes, is the most popular indigenous language of South America.

The seminar explores musical genres (madrigal, opera, cantata, etc.) using poetic texts in Italian (primarily), French, and German, which circulated mainly in Europe in both private and public settings during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Issues of reception and performance/staging during the 20th and 21st centuries are also investigated. Each instance of the seminar has a focus, e.g.: Monteverdi’s madrigals, opera in seventeenth-century Venice and Paris, Guarini and Marino in music, histories of the madrigal, Petrarchism and music, the ”Baroque” in theory and practice, Handel’s operas, staging Baroque opera today, historically informed performance practice, etc. Please see department website https://music.sas.upenn.edu/course-list/ for current term course descriptions.\nThe seminar focuses on the L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643) as a case study. This music-theatrical work is approached as a historical object and as a script for today's performances/revisitations. In the former case, we will focus on methodological issues of authoriality, narrativity, and materiality; in the latter, on mediality, theatricality, and gender. Other case studies may be considered according to students’ interests. In addition, we will discuss historiographical and theoretical notions of “Baroque,” early modernity, postmodernity, performativity, reenactment, and the postdramatic. No Italian or musical notation knowledge is required; however, we will investigate early seventeenth-century Italy's literary and performance culture, and music-analytical approaches will be discussed if interest arises. Students in Music Studies and Composition are welcome, as well as those in Francophone, Italian, and Germanic Studies, the Program in Comparative Literature & Literary Theory, and those interested in early modernity and performance studies in general.

The massive human toll of COVID-19 and demands for reparations from communities around the world confront health institutions and expose their colonial, scientific, and epistemic underpinnings. From colonial histories of medicine to movements to decolonize global and planetary health, this seminar charts how anthropological and trans-disciplinary forms of research can help shift knowledge claims about injury and vulnerability away from hegemonic centers to frontline communities. This shift implies tracking the lived aspects of health both in and beyond clinical spaces and into multiple environments (from low-wage work to toxic exposures and militarized zones) that perpetuate human/nonhuman vulnerabilities and unequal exposures to disease. As we consider multi-faceted efforts (including traditions of mutual aid and care, de-occupation and, more recently, abolition medicine) to reverse such trends, we probe innovations, forms of resistance, and ethical and political potentials unleashed by diverse justice struggles, and through which diverse planetary futures are imagined and realized.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.5,"instructor_quality":3.417,"difficulty":3.333,"work_required":3.417,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"MTR-6040","title":"Sci & Ethical Conduct","description":"In this course, students will learn the foundational principles of scientific, operational and ethical conduct of research, complete directed experience in evaluating ethical principles through IRB membership and ultimately be able to apply all principles to their own work.

Grades are based on the quality of the research itself (which should ideally be published or at least of publishable quality), as well as on the quality of the thesis and the oral presentation. The latter are evaluated jointly by the supervisor and the reader. The Senior Thesis program is selective, and students are generally expected to have a GPA is in the top 10-20% to qualify. Senior Theses are expected to integrate the knowledge and skills from earlier coursework; because of this, students are not allowed to enroll in CIS 4100 before their sixth semester.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.667,"instructor_quality":3.557,"difficulty":2.667,"work_required":3.0,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"COML-7901","title":"Rec Issues in Critical Theory","description":"This course will provide an overview of critical theory related to the study of gender and/or sexuality. Different instructors will emphasize different topics within these fields. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a complete description of the current offerings.\nScholars working on the politics of identity have embraced a range of affective statessuch as pride, shame, anger, and melancholyas theoretically and politically productive emotions.  Guilt, by contrast, is more typically attributed to others than assumed by the self. Whether in the venerable academic tradition of unmasking the errors of individual thinkers or the exclusions of entire fields, or in the more recent call-out and cancel culture of our moment, discerning the guilt of others is often a means of proclaiming the righteousness of ones self. Such assertions presume a clear distinction between an innocent victim and a guilty perpetrator and hew closely to legal claims for reparation contingent on the calculation of harm for the former and the assignment of guilt to the latter.\n\nThis seminar investigates how our scholarly and political investments might be\nconfigured differently if we embraced guiltin the sense of both culpability and contritionnot as a cynical dismissal of intellectual consistency or social justice but rather as an inevitable structural position of the subject and social movements. Throughout the semester, we will engage with philosophy, psychoanalysis, critical race theory, women of color, feminist, queer, and trans writings to explore how we might construct a different genealogy of guilt and reparation. How do we think an ethics of guilt and reparation in the wake of slavery, dispossession, occupation, genocide, and nuclear holocaust? Indeed, how does such an ethics allow us to reconsider the universalizing aspirations of the human and human rights from the perspectives of complicity, failure, and responsibility rather than those of moral authority, certainty, and blamelessness?","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"DYNM-6570","title":"Engagement W. Government","description":"Government actions play a major role in business, shaping the environment in which companies operate and making direct purchasing and investment decisions. Most organizations, however, do little to consider, respond to and shape government decisions that impact them. This course will explore ways in which the private and public sectors interact and will equip organization leaders to engage strategically with governments around the world. Students will study how government actions influence business results and will learn proven methods for optimizing growth and reducing risk from interaction with governments. The instructor will draw on his 40 years of professional experience as international government affairs leader for General Electric, as a consultant, and as a trade negotiator in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The course will use case studies and small group exercises to illustrate and emphasize key points. Students will also engage with business and government leaders, who will discuss challenges they face and successful approaches to addressing those challenges. Students will work in small groups on exercises and simulations between some class sessions and will then present their results during the subsequent class period. Reading assignments will also take place between class sessions.  There will be at least one written assignment during the course. Each student will hold at least one 20 minute 1-1 discussion of the course material with the instructor during the course period. The course schedule provides two periods for these discussions, and students can arrange an alternative time with the instructor. Students are responsible for scheduling their sessions.\nMeeting dates in Philadelphia are 3/3-5. Meeting dates in Washington, DC are 3/9-11.

Because the closer is to the contemporary world and the inherent secrecy the surrounds intelligence and counterintelligence activities, much of this class focuses on historical cases where long term public research and declassification of government documents have allowed us to look into the system and process of intelligence gathering, analysis, and recommendations for action. We will explore recurrent and prominent themes of intelligence failures, the trade-offs and calculations of a strong CI infrastructure as it relates to ethics, democracy and national power and prestige that shape our understanding of the subject and how it directly and indirectly impacts our lives and our society. Students will gain an appreciation of how the practice has been utilized by government, specifically: its structure, analytical processes, organizational culture, practice-related ethics, perception(s) by the public, guiding charter, and governmental oversight.

Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering, for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere, including social systems, markets, molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model, analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments. Prerequisite: One compter language The class's material is divided in four blocks respectively dealing with Markov chains, continuous time Markov chains, Gaussian processes and stationary processes. Emphasis is placed in the development of toolboxes to analyze these different classes of processes and on describing their applications to complex stochastic systems in different disciplines. Particular examples include: (i) the problem of ranking web pages by a search engine; (ii) the study of reputation and trust in social networks; (iii) modeling and analysis of communication networks; (iv) the use of queues in the modeling of transportation networks; (v) stochastic modeling and simulation of biochemical reactions and gene networks; (vi) arbitrages, pricing of stocks, and pricing of options through Black-Scholes formula; and (vii) linear filtering of stochastic processes to separate signals of interest from background noise.

From the very beginning of European imperialism in the Atlantic World, Muslims were integral to the history of what scholars call “Vast Early America.” Their stories are entwined with the larger threads of early American history including those of missionary work, European interimperial conflict, slavery, the genocide of Native peoples, and capitalism.

Russia is a society that takes literature seriously—one in which the pen is assumed to have direct historical consequences.

The masterworks we will study open windows into worlds of revolutionary rapture, moral uplift in the face of tyranny, courageous subversion of the repressive state, and historical reflection on its failures. Our readings will range from an avant-garde play intended to rewire your mind, to an epic representation of revolutionary social transformation, to surreal and absurdist representations of a world gone mad.

It was a time of great transition. Europe developed from an agriculturally-based to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture. From subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of goods, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part--some would say the heart--of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. Economic intensification, expansion, globalization, and industrialization are our topics, therefore. Beginning with economic organizations and practices, we will consider how these changed over time and influenced society and culture. The course takes as its point of departure the experience of individual, working men and women: peasants and artisans, merchants and landlords, entrepeneurs and financiers. Yet, it argues outward: from the particular to the general, from the individual to the social, from the local to the global. It will suggest ways in which the economy influenced developments or changes that were not in themselves economic, shaped, and deflected economic life and practice.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":2.907,"instructor_quality":3.171,"difficulty":2.413,"work_required":2.209,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"EESC-6600","title":"Adv Earth Surface Processes","description":"Patterns on the Earth's surface arise due to the transport of sediment by water and wind, with energy that is supplied by climate and tectonic deformation of the solid Earth.

Beginning with the cinematic revolution signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism (of Rossellini and De Sica), we will follow the evolution of postwar cinema through the French New Wave (of Godard, Resnais, and Varda), American movies of the 1950s and 1960s (including the New Hollywood cinema of Coppola and Scorsese), and the various other new wave movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (such as the New German Cinema). We will then selectively examine some of the most important films of the last three decades, including those of U.S. independent film movement and movies from Iran, China, and elsewhere in an expanding global cinema culture. There will be precise attention paid to formal and stylistic techniques in editing, mise-en-scene, and sound, as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of film. At the same time, those formal features will be closely linked to historical and cultural distinctions and changes, ranging from the Paramount Decision of 1948 to the digital convergences that are defining screen culture today. There are no perquisites. Requirements will include readings in film history and film analysis, an analytical essay, a research paper, weekly Canvas postings, and active participation in class discussion.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":2,"course_quality":2.953,"instructor_quality":3.179,"difficulty":1.976,"work_required":2.225,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"YORB-0400","title":"Intermediate Yoruba II","description":"Continuation of Intermediate I course:  Level 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":4.0,"instructor_quality":4.0,"difficulty":null,"work_required":0.5,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ZULU-0200","title":"Elementary Zulu II","description":"The Elementary Zulu II course can be taken to fulfill a language requirement, or for linguistic preparation to do research on South Africa, Southern Africa/Africa-related topics.

However, each country and community has had a different encounter and experience with colonialism. For the Adivasis (indigenous peoples) of India, it was catastrophic and marked a new phase in their history. The pre-colonial symbolizes a period of freedom in the hills and forest, whereas the colonial era symbolizes state coercion, eviction from land and the end of free movement in the forest. The proposed course discusses Adivasis' encounters with the British colonial state. The course examines Indian history from the perspectives of Adivasis and contrasts these with dominant paradigms of Indian history. In this way, the course allows students to understand India from a different perspective.\nUnder British colonialism, the diverse ethnic self-governing communities were imagined as primitive, uncivilized, barbaric, violent, backward and childlike people. The course discusses how such constructions impacted Adivasi social life and development. It traces how the expansion of the colonial state in forests and hills put an end to self-rule and induced massive migration from the plains of India and asks how Adivasi areas were integrated into the colonial economy. How did the colonial state use revenue and forest policies and regulations to bring these areas under its control? How did commercialization of agriculture and forest conservation work to further marginalize Adivasis? The course also examines how Adivasi knowledge of cultivation and forest conservation were viewed by the colonial state and asks why the colonial state encouraged caste-Hindu peasant migration into Adivasi areas. Finally, it traces the ways that colonial intervention has resulted in a series of contestations, acts of resistance, and insurgencies by Adivasi groups? Tracing forms of Adivasi resistance, the course puts these into conversation with intellectual history, emphasizing the role of rumours, myths, and orality, which provided the basis for the new insurgent consciousness that spread throughout Adivasi communities.\nAdivasi resistance movements have been documented and analyzed by colonial rulers and anthropologists. Colonial discourses were successful in criminalizing Adivasi politics. Ironically, many colonial-era discourses concerning Adivasis have been perpetuated within the post-colonial academy. The anti-colonial struggles of Adivasis were constructed as sporadic, spontaneous, unorganized and apolitical.

However, each country and community has had a different encounter and experience with colonialism. For the Adivasis (indigenous peoples) of India, it was catastrophic and marked a new phase in their history. The pre-colonial symbolizes a period of freedom in the hills and forest, whereas the colonial era symbolizes state coercion, eviction from land and the end of free movement in the forest. The proposed course discusses Adivasis' encounters with the British colonial state. The course examines Indian history from the perspectives of Adivasis and contrasts these with dominant paradigms of Indian history. In this way, the course allows students to understand India from a different perspective.\nUnder British colonialism, the diverse ethnic self-governing communities were imagined as primitive, uncivilized, barbaric, violent, backward and childlike people. The course discusses how such constructions impacted Adivasi social life and development. It traces how the expansion of the colonial state in forests and hills put an end to self-rule and induced massive migration from the plains of India and asks how Adivasi areas were integrated into the colonial economy. How did the colonial state use revenue and forest policies and regulations to bring these areas under its control? How did commercialization of agriculture and forest conservation work to further marginalize Adivasis? The course also examines how Adivasi knowledge of cultivation and forest conservation were viewed by the colonial state and asks why the colonial state encouraged caste-Hindu peasant migration into Adivasi areas. Finally, it traces the ways that colonial intervention has resulted in a series of contestations, acts of resistance, and insurgencies by Adivasi groups? Tracing forms of Adivasi resistance, the course puts these into conversation with intellectual history, emphasizing the role of rumours, myths, and orality, which provided the basis for the new insurgent consciousness that spread throughout Adivasi communities.\nAdivasi resistance movements have been documented and analyzed by colonial rulers and anthropologists. Colonial discourses were successful in criminalizing Adivasi politics. Ironically, many colonial-era discourses concerning Adivasis have been perpetuated within the post-colonial academy. The anti-colonial struggles of Adivasis were constructed as sporadic, spontaneous, unorganized and apolitical. The inauguration of the Subaltern Studies Project has reversed such arguments and attempted to provide ideological integrity to Adivasi politics. Students will be introduced to important literature on Adivasi anti-colonial insurgent consciousness and will be encouraged to think critically about the concepts and theories of subaltern politics. Assigned readings include texts by James Scott, Ranajit Guha, David Arnold, David Hardiman, Ajay Skaria, Dhanagare, Ramachandra Guha, Biswamoy Pati, Alpa Shah, Crispin Bates, Jangkhomang Guite and Bhangya Bhukya.

Is the unsettling nausea in my stomach the result of my neighbor’s cough or a metabolic imbalance caused by something I ate.  And what about love!  According to Andreas Capellanus, writing almost a thousand years ago, “love is a certain inborn affliction, caused by the sight and excessive meditation on the opposite sex.” Ibn Zaydun, writing from Córdoba about the same time, would agree, describing himself as a man so wasted by love that he became “too thin to see.”  In this seminar we trace the idea of love as a disease and affliction as a unifying thread for exploring the literatures and literary traditions of love from the Iberian medieval and early modern periods, beginning with Hispano-Arabic love poetry and Galician-Portuguese Troubadour songs and ending with Cervantes Don Quixote I (1605), which we will read as a culmination of the Iberian (and European) literary love traditions.

A few days later, a public performance of the song “Sunday” was organized in Duffy Square by Lin-Manuel Miranda. A new production of Into the Woods is currently on Broadway, and another of Sweeney Todd is planned for February 2023.\nThough it’s been nearly 15 years since Sondheim’s final new musical, he is very much part of our theatrical present—through his own works, which continue to be produced internationally, and through his influence on several generations of composers, lyricists, and more. Still today, among theatre critics and a large sector of the public, Sondheim is generally considered the most significant composer and lyricist in the contemporary theatre; he is, in fact, accorded the kind of serious consideration generally reserved for “legitimate” playwrights.\nIn this seminar, we will examine in detail Stephen Sondheim’s writing over six decades. We’ll begin with Sondheim’s earliest work as a lyricist, collaborating with composers Jule Styne (Gypsy), Leonard Bernstein (West Side Story), and later, Richard Rodgers (Do I Hear a Waltz?). Beginning in 1970, Sondheim – now both composer and lyricist – in partnership with director Harold Prince produced a series of musicals (including Company, Follies and Sweeney Todd,) still thought to be among the most innovative and substantial in the history of the genre.\nWe will also focus on Sondheim's musicals after his 1981 break with Prince.  These later works, created with writers and directors including James Lapine (Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Passion), Jerry Zaks (Assassins), and John Doyle (Road Show) are often smaller in scale, intensely personal, and incorporate elements of performance art and popular culture.\nFinally, we will consider revival productions of Sondheim’s work, which often are reconceived from their original form, often with Sondheim’s involvement and occasional rewriting.\nThis course is open to all students interested in theatre and musical theatre.

We’ll begin with Sondheim’s earliest work as a lyricist, collaborating with composers Jule Styne (Gypsy), Leonard Bernstein (West Side Story), and later, Richard Rodgers (Do I Hear a Waltz?). Beginning in 1970, Sondheim – now both composer and lyricist – in partnership with director Harold Prince produced a series of musicals (including Company, Follies and Sweeney Todd,) still thought to be among the most innovative and substantial in the history of the genre.\nWe will also focus on Sondheim's musicals after his 1981 break with Prince.

By exploring acting techniques that bridge stage and screen, students will gain experience with producing professional self-tapes that reflect current industry standards, understanding the complexity of framing, vocal quality and eyelines in Zoom callbacks, and experimenting with the use of digital media in theatre.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ENGL-3014","title":"Intro to Creative Writing","description":"This workshop-style course will serve as an introduction to writing fiction and essays.

Beyond serving as illustrations in literary, ethnographic, and journalistic texts, photographs have long inspired authors. Some write about photographers or depict scenes of photography. Others collaborate with photographers or pick up the camera themselves, practicing photography in conjunction with (or as a separate, parallel endeavor to) their writing. Others still set out to imitate photography’s descriptive capacity in their prose or to reveal aspects of reality that the camera cannot hope to capture. As we read such literary texts closely, alongside photographs and critical essays on photography, we will ask: What kinds of storytelling do literature and photography make possible, separately and together? What is each medium uniquely equipped to show us? How do they speak to each other in unexpected ways?  \n","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ENGL-3026","title":"Writing Real Science","description":"In this course, students will read and write fiction and nonfiction with an eye for science research.

Amid an intensifying climate crisis and widespread air pollution, an ongoing airborne pandemic, and the terrible refrain of “I can’t breathe” that has echoed for a decade, the politicization of breath speaks to the precarity of our time. Relatedly, we are paying more attention to our bodily movement: how, when, and why it is or feels restricted, and the many tactics we can use, in both big and small spaces, to feel more free in our bodies. More than ever, we are aware of how breath and movement tie us to one another. In this creative writing workshop, we will engage with poetry, prose, and performance to study how artists and writers are thinking about breath and movement today. Our critical and creative work together will especially prioritize the experiences and perspectives of Black and Indigenous peoples, and People of Color more broadly. Guided by Black Feminist Theories of embodied knowledge as an alternate form of knowledge production, we will also use our class sessions to cultivate movement-based practices that will enable us to attend to our own breathing as the basis for our creative writing. We will engage with work by artists and writers including Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Nathaniel Mackey, Vi Khi Nao, Charles Olson, and Malcolm Peacock, among others. Workshops with visiting artists and practitioners will include breath-centered meditation, strength training, and guided, intentional walking. Throughout the course, students will create their own poetry, prose, and performance scores that encourage themselves and others to attend more carefully to their breath and movement.\nThis workshop style class will combine creative writing exercises and guided movement practices that draw our critical attention to breath and breathing, at a time when both have become highly politicized.

Throughout the semester, we will engage with visiting artists and practitioners who will guide us through movement practices including breath-focused meditation and intentional walking, and students will produce their own creative writing or movement scores.

While the curriculum will be tailored to the interests and linguistic backgrounds of the students who enroll, all those curious about world poetry and the formidable, irresistible act of translation are welcome. Those wishing to take the translation course should have, at least, an intermediate knowledge of another language. We will study multiple translations of major poems and render our own versions in response. Students with knowledge of other languages will have the additional opportunity to work directly from the original. A portion of the course will be set up as a creative writing workshop in which to examine the overall effect of each others’ translations so that first drafts can become successful revisions. While class discussions will explore the contexts and particularity of poetry writen in Urdu, Italian, Arabic, French, Bulgarian, and Polish, they might ultimately reveal how notions of national literature have radically shifted in recent years to more polyglottic and globally textured forms. Through famous poems, essays on translation theory, and our own ongoing experiments, this course will celebrate the ways in which great poetry underscores the fact that language itself is a translation. In addition to the creative work, assignments will include an oral presentation, informal response papers, and a short final essay.\n\"Human words Human words have no main switch. But all those little kidnaps in the dark.Anne Carson\n\nIn this class we will study multiple translations of famous poems by major world poets such as Shu Ting, Gabriela Mistral, Mahmoud Darwish, Anna Akhmatova, Aim Csaire, and Paul Celan. The curriculum will be tailored to the backgrounds of students who enroll, and all are welcome.\n\nAlternating between creative writing workshops (to critique and revise our own translations of the poems) and critical discussions, the course will also include presentations on the political and geographical frames that shape each text. For example, our translations of Aim Csaire will be informed by his scholarship on colonialism. Translating Osip Mandelstams Stalin Epigram will bring us to Soviet Russias forced famine in Ukraine. Discussions of Israel and Palestine will surround our translations of Israeli poet Dahlia Ravikovitch, or of Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish. Informal and dynamic history classes will form the undercurrent of our formal poetry class.\n\nThrough poems, essays on translation theory, and our own ongoing experiments, this course will celebrate the ways in which great poetrywritten in Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew, French, Hindi, or Russianunderscores the fact that language itself is a translation.

We will be using searing and famous images from history books. We will be taking things from yesterday’s newspaper. We will even be using pictures that were just made by the workshop participants outside the campus gates with a disposable camera from CVS or with their own sophisticated digital Nikon. In all of this, there will be one overriding aim: to achieve memorable, full-bodied stories. To locate the strange, evocative, storytelling universes that are sealed inside the four rectangular walls of a photograph. They are always there, if you know how to look. It’s about the quality of your noticing, the intensity of your seeing. Writers as diverse as the poet Mark Strand and the novelist Don DeLillo and the memoirist Wright Morris have long recognized the power of a photograph to launch a story. In this course we are going to employ memory and imagination to launch our stories, but most of all we are going to make use of fact: everything that can be found out, gleaned, uncovered, dug up, stumbled upon.

So a lot of this class will go forward using the tools and techniques of journalism: good, old-fashioned reporting and research, legwork. And turning that reporting into writing gold. A photograph represents time stopped in a box. It is a kind of freeze-frame of eternity. It is stopped motion, in which the clock has seemed to hold its breath. Often, the stories inside photographs turn out to be at surprising odds with what we otherwise thought, felt, imagined. Say, for instance, that you hunger to enter the photographic heart of this youthful, handsome, dark-haired man—who is your father—as he leans now against the gleaming bumper of a 1965 red-leather, bucket-seat Mustang. It was three decades before you were born. The moment is long buried and forgotten in your collective family’s past—and yet in another way, it is right here before you, on this photosensitive surface. Whether the figure in the photograph is alive or deceased, you are now going to try with all of your writing and reporting might to “walk back in.” Almost literally. You are going to achieve a story about this moment, with a beginning, middle, and end. “Every great photograph has a secret,” a noted critic once said.

It was three decades before you were born. The moment is long buried and forgotten in your collective family's past - and yet in another way, it is right here before you, on this photosensitive surface. Whether the figure in the photograph is alive or deceased, you are now going to try with all of your writing and reporting might to \"walk back in.\" Almost literally. You are going to achieve a story about this moment, with a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nEvery great photograph has a secret, a noted critic once said. An essayist for Time magazine once wrote: \"All great photographs have lives of their own. But sometimes they can be false as dreams.\"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.695,"instructor_quality":3.743,"difficulty":2.581,"work_required":2.654,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ENGL-3426","title":"The Art of Editing","description":"This course takes a critical and practical approach to the art of editing. Is the editor simply a “failed writer,” as T. S. Eliot claimed, or is good editing the key to a writer’s clarity and integrity? In addition to exploring theories and histories of the red pen, we will consider a few case studies of editorial interventions, such as Ezra Pound’s excisions and revisions of Eliot’s The Waste Land, Marianne Moore’s five-decade quest to revise a single poem, and the editor who was discovered to have invented Raymond Carver’s distinctive narrative style. We will immerse ourselves in the technical aspects of editing, covering such topics as the difference between developmental and line editing, the merits of MLA and Chicago style, proofreading in hard copy and digital environments, and when to wield an em dash. Students will gain practical editing experience, learn about a range of different levels of editorial interventions, and investigate the politics of language usage and standards, reading from literary texts such as Gloria Anzaldúa’s “How to Tame a Wild Tongue,” Harryette Mullen’s Sleeping with the Dictionary, and Dohra Ahmad’s Rotten English anthology to ask crucial questions about what “standard English” really means.\nThis course takes a critical and practical approach to the art of editing.

But it is also about writing that exceeds the limits of form to arrive at the poetic; when the drive to put down experience in poems spills out into prose (and vice versa), or when the borders of poetic form seem to be incapable of holding or transferring experience into language. Essentially we will explore how writing influenced by borders seeks to occupy space, not in the real sense, but in the abstract—where language and content are always in tension with one another to achieve new forms, or where writing, as one poet and critic puts it “gains distinction not from content, but from what content demands—the renewal of poetic resources.” We will also explore the possibilities of these statements in our own experimentations to achieve form in poetry and prose.\nThis workshop is about experiments in writing that exceeds the limits of form: when the drive to put down experience in poems spills out into prose, or when the borders provided for the experience seem to hold for the moment, only to collapse the moment after. This particular writing drive seeks to occupy space, not in the real sense, but in the abstract - where the insider goes out, and the outsider hides in. This ever-acting dichotomy in writing poems is often brought out in times of personal crisis, but most distinctly in times of conflict and war (and where the lines and borders on the ground need to be drawn clearly, the disillusionment with the human self provides a most fertile ground for breaking out of the poem, for seeking the poetic outside defined lines). We will explore the possibilities of these statements in our own experimentations in achieving form in a poem, and then breaking out of it in prose. We will be guided in this process by some of the following texts: 1. modern rewritings of The Iliad, such as War Music by Chris Logue and Memorial by Alice Oswald; 2. autobiographies such as The Invention of Solitude by Paul Auster and The Words by Jean-Paul Sartre; and 3. the poems and prose of poets such as W.

Tax policy, including deductions, subsidies and credits, are one tool that lawmakers can use to get more cash in the hands of individuals and families, especially for low-income groups. Students will consider the effectiveness and usefulness of tax policies relative to other tools that the government has available. There are three guest lecturers for the sessions on tax policy: Wharton Professors Alex Rees-Jones and Kent Smetters, and Professor Amy Beth Castro from SP2.\n(4) Working with people. Volunteering with VITA requires students to work with people from a low-income community on the sensitive issue of personal finances.  Students will learn to discuss sensitive financial issues with lower-income adults (including many seniors) through readings and in-class discussions, and by reflecting on their real-life experiences in the local community.  This skill is important in a variety of roles such as healthcare (physicians and nurses), business (e.g., the HR function), and education.\nThe community service part of the course is volunteering with VITA, which is the IRS’s “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance” program.  Following training, students will perform tax services for the West Philadelphia community during the 2023 tax season.

Students are expected to be in the field performing service throughout a significant portion of the semester.\nAs described on the IRS website, the VITA program has operated for over 50 years.

We’ll compare how non-western performances offer different relationships with the environment.

We will ground our examination of the period in a growing global black consciousness, as well as the relationship between black aesthetics and self-determination. The course will explore a breadth of mid twentieth century Black experimental theatre ranging from Jean Genet’s The Blacks and Imamu Amiri Baraka’s Black Arts Repertory Theater and School, to Ntozake Shange’s Choreopoems, and the performance poetry Jayne Cortez. The course culminates in the work of present-day performance artists that have taken up and evolved the form.\nThe course is designed to incorporate theory and practice through play and poetry readings, movement investigations, student presentations of Theatre/Performance Artists, and viewing performances either virtually or in person.

In the face of the climate crisis, this question feels especially urgent. This course will consider the relationship of theatre to the environment and climate change, looking at how we got to this point, and where we might go from here. We will consider how ideas about the environment have been spread through classic texts such as Shakespeare’s The Tempest and Ibsen’s Enemy of the People. We’ll compare how non-western performances offer different relationships with the environment. And we’ll analyze how performance has responded to climate anxiety; through visions of dystopia and an end of the world, as in Caryl Churchill’s The Skriker and Anne Washburn’s Mr. Burns, A Post-Electric Play; through arts activism; and through experimental performance like environmental and immersive theatre. This course is for anyone who is concerned about climate change and interested in how the arts could respond. Most sessions will function as seminar, with short lectures and in-depth discussion about artistic and theoretical texts. We will also workshop different ideas on their feet. The aim is for students to become comfortable enough with this artistic and theoretical mode that they can critique performances across genres from this perspective, articulate their own relationship to it, and see how it might inform their own work.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":0,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"BEPP-2110","title":"Tax Policy & Practice","description":"The academic component of the course will focus on several areas:\n(1) The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap. Students will read this book throughout the semester to support their understanding of the community that they will be serving.\n(2) Statutory tax system. Students will learn about the tax system as it relates to individuals and sole proprietors.  The VITA training covers general tax preparation, with a specific focus on tax credits available to VITA-eligible taxpayers and the use of VITA software.  In addition, one session of the course will include a guest lecture/discussion by Professor Jennifer Blouin.  She will focus on statutory tax issues related to organizational form choice for self-employed and gig economy workers, which is an important statutory issue in low-income communities.\n(3) Social policy debate. Tax policy, including deductions, subsidies and credits, are one tool that lawmakers can use to get more cash in the hands of individuals and families, especially for low-income groups. Students will consider the effectiveness and usefulness of tax policies relative to other tools that the government has available. There are three guest lecturers for the sessions on tax policy: Wharton Professors Alex Rees-Jones and Kent Smetters, and Professor Amy Beth Castro from SP2.\n(4) Working with people. Volunteering with VITA requires students to work with people from a low-income community on the sensitive issue of personal finances.  Students will learn to discuss sensitive financial issues with lower-income adults (including many seniors) through readings and in-class discussions, and by reflecting on their real-life experiences in the local community.  This skill is important in a variety of roles such as healthcare (physicians and nurses), business (e.g., the HR function), and education.\nThe community service part of the course is volunteering with VITA, which is the IRS’s “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance” program.  Following training, students will perform tax services for the West Philadelphia community during the 2023 tax season.  The course will meet once a week in three-hour sessions for 8-9 weeks during the Spring semester.  Students are expected to be in the field performing service throughout a significant portion of the semester.\nAs described on the IRS website, the VITA program has operated for over 50 years. Volunteers offer free tax help to people who need assistance in preparing their own tax returns, including:\n•\tPeople who generally make $58,000 or less\n•\tPersons with disabilities; and\n•\tLimited English-speaking taxpayers.\nAuditors need permission.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GSWS-2100","title":"Trauma Porn to Title IX","description":"What does it mean to center survivors?

By 1850, the United States sent a greater fraction of its children to school than any other nation on earth. Why? What did young people learn there? And, most of all, how did these institutions both reflect and shape our evolving conceptions of \"America\" itself?  In an irreducibly diverse society, the answers were never simple. Americans have always defined their nation in a myriad of contrasting and often contradictory ways. So they have also clashed vehemently over their schools, which remain our central public vehicle for deliberating and disseminating the values that we wish to transmit to our young. Our course will pay close attention to these education-related debates, especially in the realms of race, class, and religion. When immigrants came here from other shores, would they have to relinquish their old cultures and languages? When African-Americans won their freedom from bondage, what status would they assume? And as different religious denominations fanned out across the country, how would they balance the uncompromising demands of faith with the pluralistic imperatives of democracy? All of these questions came into relief at school, where the answers changed dramatically over time. Early American teachers blithely assumed that newcomers would abandon their old-world habits and tongues; today, \"multicultural education\" seeks to preserve or even to celebrate these distinctive patterns. Post-emancipation white philanthropists designed vocational curricula for freed African-Americans, imagining blacks as loyal serfs; but blacks themselves demanded a more academic education, which  would set them on the road to equality. Protestants and Catholics both used the public schools to teach their faith systems until the early 1960s, when the courts barred them from doing so; but religious controversies continue to hound the schools, especially on matters like evolution and sex education. How should our public schools address such dilemmas? How can the schools provide a \"common\" educaiton, as Horace Mann called it, melding us into an integrated whole while still respecting our inevitable differences?","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.518,"instructor_quality":3.705,"difficulty":2.795,"work_required":3.187,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"JWST-2225","title":"Relig Conflict & Coexistence","description":"Europe’s early modern period (roughly 1450-1750) has been described an “age of religious wars,” with the Reformation and contact with the New World prompting the formation of new fault lines, new collectives, and the reshaping of old animosities in new expressions.

Despite the extreme polarization between Paris and provincial France in both cultural and socio-economic terms, cultural historians have argued that Paris is a symbol of France (as a centralized nation), more than Rome is of Italy and much more than Madrid is of Spain or Berlin of Germany, for example. The prevalence of the City of Lights on our screens, Gallic and otherwise, should therefore come as no surprise, be it as a mere backdrop or as a character in its own right. But how exactly are the French capital and its variegated people captured on celluloid? Can we find significant differences between French and non-French approaches, or between films shot on location that have the ring of \"authenticity\" and studio-bound productions using reconstructed sets? Do these representations vary through time and perhaps reflect specific historical periods or zeitgeists?  Do they conform to genre-based formulas and perpetuate age-old stereotypes, or do they provide new, original insights while revisiting cinematic conventions?

And we will learn the basics of creating virtual reality, making fully immersive 3-D, 360-degree films with geospatial soundscapes. Finally, we will take what we have learned out of the classroom, working with the Philadelphia Museum of Art curators to create virtual realty experiences based around the museum's objects and exhibits. Students will gain an understanding of the unique approaches needed to appeal to museum visitors in a public setting, so we can make viable experiences for them.

Despite the extreme polarization between Paris and provincial France in both cultural and socio-economic terms, cultural historians have argued that Paris is a symbol of France (as a centralized nation), more than Rome is of Italy and much more than Madrid is of Spain or Berlin of Germany, for example. The prevalence of the City of Lights on our screens, Gallic and otherwise, should therefore come as no surprise, be it as a mere backdrop or as a character in its own right. But how exactly are the French capital and its variegated people captured on celluloid? Can we find significant differences between French and non-French approaches, or between films shot on location that have the ring of \"authenticity\" and studio-bound productions using reconstructed sets? Do these representations vary through time and perhaps reflect specific historical periods or zeitgeists?  Do they conform to genre-based formulas and perpetuate age-old stereotypes, or do they provide new, original insights while revisiting cinematic conventions? Do some (sub)urban areas and/or segments of the Parisian population (in terms of gender, race, or class, for example) receive special attention or treatment?

This instruction begins at the pre-clinical in the second year endodontic lecture series (670) and is expanded and reinforced in pre-doctoral laboratory course (672). Students present to the Endodontic Clinic to render care either on their own patients or on patients referred for endodontic emergencies. Case assignment will be handled by clinical faculty and the endodontic business office based on the AAE case difficulty guidelines. In a student's Endodontic Emergency rotation, they are instructed in the proper diagnosis and assessment of emergency cases, appropriate treatment (both emergency and scheduled appointment visits), pertinent paperwork and follow up of emergency patients. The pre-doctoral student, at the discretion of the faculty member on duty, may elect to retain the emergency patient for further treatment or, if the case is deemed too difficult or the student elects not to treat that particular patient, the appropriate referral to another pre-doctoral or a post- doctoral student is made. Regularly scheduled patients are treated in the Endodontic Clinic. Appointments are made by the treating students through the Endodontic Business Office. Supervision ranges from chair-side direct supervision for those students identified as having limited endodontic experience, to that of indirect supervision for those having completed more cases involving anterior and posterior teeth.

The authors studied come from differing walks of life, social classes, and religious and political identifications, and they express themselves in a wide variety of genres, including short stories, fairy tales, lyric poetry, letters, plays, and novels. Despite their many differences, these authors are united by a common tendency to question a centuries-old tradition of misogynistic discourse, patriarchal social order, and gender normativity.\nAuthors to be studied include:\n- Marie de France (ca. 1160), a brilliant storyteller and poet attached to the court of Henry II of England whose fabulous tales, arguably an early form of speculative fiction, imagine alternatives to the rigidity of arranged marriages and the heterosexual couple.\n- Christine de Pizan (1364–ca. 1430), a court writer for Charles VI of France and several other powerful patrons who is often considered France’s first professional female writer. Her Livre de la Cité des Dames (Book of the City of Ladies) systematically refutes the misogynistic pronouncements of learned male authors and holds up devotion and religious life as alternatives to accepting the assigned role of wife and mother.\n- Marguerite de Navarre (1492–1549), the sister of Francis I of France and a prolific author of devotional poetry, plays, and the Heptaméron, a collection of tales modeled on Boccaccio’s Decameron and known for its often shocking subject matter. Throughout her oeuvre, she calls into question the social perception of women rooted in misogynistic discourse, as well as the tendency to blame sexual violence on women, while at the same time revealing the potential danger of masculinity for men and women alike and envisioning Pauline Christianity as a means of radical equality.\n- Pernette du Guillet (1520–1545), Louise Labé (c. 1524–1566), and Anne de Marquets (1533–1588), three poets who respond to and write against the male-centered tradition of Petrarchan love poetry. Guillet and Labé stand out for their frank and often sensual depictions of female desire and sexuality in spite of taboos against their public expression, while Marquets, a Dominican nun at the convent of Poissy, combines Petrarchan, devotional, and mystic tropes to envision religious life as an alternative to the heteronormativity of lay French society and the Protestant Reformation.\n- Madame de Lafayette (1634–1693) and Madame de Sévigné (1626–1696), whose writings are of monumental importance in the history of literature in French as well as invaluable testimonies to the role played by women in the intellectual developments of the early modern period, including salons, Jansenism, and free-thinking (libertinism).\n- Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve (1685–1755), author of the first known version of La belle et la bête (Beauty and the Beast), who, along with other female authors of fairy tales, used the conventions of the genre to challenge social conventions and criticize the treatment of women.\n - Claire de Duras (1777–1828), whose novel Ourika, much like Villeneuve’s La belle et la bête, shows how feminist concerns might intersect with colonialism and race; a bestseller in its day, it is one of the first works in French to feature a complex and articulate black narrator and what many scholars consider to be a modern outlook on race and identity.\nTo provide historical and theoretical context, these readings will be supplemented with relevant primary and secondary sources, as well as with modern and contemporary adaptations, such as illustrations and films.

Why do we repeat the mistakes we have made before? 5) Why is it that the \"Developed and Advanced\" countries of the world are destroying the planet? This highly interactive, flexible, and remarkably diverse online course will offer frames to observe the paradox in ourselves, our families, our friendships, our workplace, and our relationships with individuals, teams, and systems--the three units of analysis that constitute every paradoxical situation. Paradox appears in our organizations, our relationships, and our experience as contributing members and leaders of our society. The value proposition of this course is for managers, leaders, and strategic thinkers who wish to understand the art and science behind the paradoxes in the systems within which we live and operate--the visible and the invisible and the rational and irrational. Understanding the unconscious  forces that lead to inconsistencies and contradictions will help us be resilient in the face of paradox. This online course will have weekly synchronous and asynchronous sessions of 2-3 hours in length. Through guest speakers and multiple interdisciplinary discussions, we will explore many angles of our understanding of paradoxes. Course grading will be based on class participation, contribution to the collective wisdom, and academic excellence in written assignments.

The authors studied come from differing walks of life, social classes, and religious and political identifications, and they express themselves in a wide variety of genres, including short stories, fairy tales, lyric poetry, letters, plays, and novels. Despite their many differences, these authors are united by a common tendency to question a centuries-old tradition of misogynistic discourse, patriarchal social order, and gender normativity.\nAuthors to be studied include:\n- Marie de France (ca. 1160), a brilliant storyteller and poet attached to the court of Henry II of England whose fabulous tales, arguably an early form of speculative fiction, imagine alternatives to the rigidity of arranged marriages and the heterosexual couple.\n- Christine de Pizan (1364–ca. 1430), a court writer for Charles VI of France and several other powerful patrons who is often considered France’s first professional female writer. Her Livre de la Cité des Dames (Book of the City of Ladies) systematically refutes the misogynistic pronouncements of learned male authors and holds up devotion and religious life as alternatives to accepting the assigned role of wife and mother.\n- Marguerite de Navarre (1492–1549), the sister of Francis I of France and a prolific author of devotional poetry, plays, and the Heptaméron, a collection of tales modeled on Boccaccio’s Decameron and known for its often shocking subject matter. Throughout her oeuvre, she calls into question the social perception of women rooted in misogynistic discourse, as well as the tendency to blame sexual violence on women, while at the same time revealing the potential danger of masculinity for men and women alike and envisioning Pauline Christianity as a means of radical equality.\n- Pernette du Guillet (1520–1545), Louise Labé (c. 1524–1566), and Anne de Marquets (1533–1588), three poets who respond to and write against the male-centered tradition of Petrarchan love poetry. Guillet and Labé stand out for their frank and often sensual depictions of female desire and sexuality in spite of taboos against their public expression, while Marquets, a Dominican nun at the convent of Poissy, combines Petrarchan, devotional, and mystic tropes to envision religious life as an alternative to the heteronormativity of lay French society and the Protestant Reformation.\n- Madame de Lafayette (1634–1693) and Madame de Sévigné (1626–1696), whose writings are of monumental importance in the history of literature in French as well as invaluable testimonies to the role played by women in the intellectual developments of the early modern period, including salons, Jansenism, and free-thinking (libertinism).\n- Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve (1685–1755), author of the first known version of La belle et la bête (Beauty and the Beast), who, along with other female authors of fairy tales, used the conventions of the genre to challenge social conventions and criticize the treatment of women.\n - Claire de Duras (1777–1828), whose novel Ourika, much like Villeneuve’s La belle et la bête, shows how feminist concerns might intersect with colonialism and race; a bestseller in its day, it is one of the first works in French to feature a complex and articulate black narrator and what many scholars consider to be a modern outlook on race and identity.\nTo provide historical and theoretical context, these readings will be supplemented with relevant primary and secondary sources, as well as with modern and contemporary adaptations, such as illustrations and films.

Design After the Digital interrogates the role of design for this century. The seminar survyes the conceptual and technical developments in the past decade to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of design, science and technology. We will study how new design and fabrication methods shape what we eat, what we wear, how we form opinions and express ourselves. The goal will be to develop new literacies of design that will help us acclimate better to the realities of the century as creative and critical citizens who can shape its products and values.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":2,"course_quality":2.784,"instructor_quality":2.946,"difficulty":2.128,"work_required":2.168,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"DSGN-2030","title":"Book&Publication Design","description":"Book and Publication Design will focus on the theory and profesional practice of designing multi-page publications.

Student doctors obtain and assess the comprehensive medical and oral health status of the patients.  Students gain knowledge of clinical pharmacology, general and specialty medical issues including physical examination findings, associated laboratory medicine and other medical studies. The rotation also includes experience in performing an oral and extraoral exam such that the student is able to recognize deviations from normal findings, and is able to perform a head and neck cancer examination and issue a risk assessment.  The student will also gain radiological experience including the appropriate selection and taking of radiographs. Additionally, the student will select the frequency of updating the complete medical history of the patient based upon complexity or at a minimum recommending that the patient be re-assessed annually.\nMedical consult requests for patients Not Medically Cleared – Each D4 student doctor is required to obtain at least 2 medical consults. The medical consult request is the mechanism used to communicate with peers and other healthcare professionals when appropriate. These will be formative experiences and are separate from what is required in Admissions. Each of the 2 formative experiences must include requesting necessary medical information, reviewing the obtained information and formulating a management plan specific for the patient in the context of the necessary dental treatment.\nPatient care - Successful dental treatment of patients with disabilities and complex medical histories requires a thorough understanding of\nbehavior management, internal medicine and how medical conditions can potentially complicate dental care. The PCare clinic trains you with effective strategies to prevent medical emergencies in a dental clinic, as well as how to behaviourally manage patients with special needs so as to make them comfortable with treatment in a dental clinic. This is achieved by having adequate knowledge of: behavioural management methods, frequent medical conditions; making necessary treatment adjustments and closely monitoring patients during dental treatment.

A hybrid research seminar, field exploration, and studio investigation, the structure of this course alternates between reading/response/research, field trips and guest visitors (including a partnership affiliation with RAIR Philly), and time for responsive “making” and material experimentation/synthesis.\nIn this course, students will collaboratively define key terms and concerns around material sustainability, discard studies, land and labor relations vis-a-vis creative work. Students will experience local sites of material extraction, production and disposal (through approx 5 field trips taking place during class time). Students will formulate individual or group questions around a specific material, leading to a final independent project, and class exhibition.

Grading - the shaping and sculpting of the landform - is both art and science, and thus Workshop II aims to provide an appreciation of landform as an evocative component in the design vocabulary as well as a critical tool in solving difficult design problems. The basic techniques and strategies of grading design (slopes, terraces, water management, grade change devices) will be introduced, practiced and reinforced, so that grading design becomes an integral part of the students' design approach. Lecture, field trips, modeling, in-class exercises, and group projects will be used. The Planting component provides students with a working overview of the principles and processes of planting design. Plants will be considered both as individual elements and as part of larger dynamic systems. The natural distribution of plants, concepts of plant community and successional patterns, and the relationship of planting an topography will be used as the initial framework for planting design. Planting design typologies will be examined as an outgrowth of these \"natural\" patterns. The role of plants as a key element in the structural design of the landscape will be explored through a combination of modeling, plan and section drawing, temporal studies, writing, field trips and case studies. Emphasis will be placed on process and evolution: the temporality of planting (daily, seasonal and annual changes), establishment and maintenance of plantings, and the process of planting design. During the first week of May, a five-day field ecology course focuses on techniques of urban revitalization, sustainable land use, reclamation, and restoration. The field trips offer insight into the diversity of approaches to using plants to promote positive environmental change.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":2,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"CIMS-2001","title":"Modern Sci-Fi Cinema","description":"Science Fiction has been a cinematic genre for as long as there has been cinema—at least since Georges Melies’s visionary Trip to the Moon in 1902. However, though science fiction films have long been reliable box office earners and cult phenomena, critical acknowledgement and analysis was slow to develop. Still, few genres reflect the sensibility of their age so transparently—if often unconsciously—or provide so many opportunities for filmmakers to simultaneously address social issues and expand the lexicon with new technologies. Given budgetary considerations and the appetite for franchises, science fiction auteurs face a difficult negotiation between artistic expression and lowest common denominator imperatives, the controversy over Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (1985) being perhaps the most infamous example. Nevertheless, many notable filmmakers have done their most perceptive and influential work in the scifi realm, including Gilliam, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, Paul Verhoeven, James Cameron and Alfonso Cuaron. This course will survey the scope of contemporary science fiction cinema, after looking first at seminal works like Metropolis (1927) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that continue to cast their shadow over the genre. We will then devote considerable time to a pair of more modern films, Scott’s Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), which drew from earlier movements (German expressionism, noir), influenced new ones (cyberpunk) and inspired a rare wave of academic discourse. Over the course of the term we will sample smaller, more independent-minded projects, such as Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Spike Jonze’s Her (2013) as well as higher profile but much more risky epics from filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":0,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-5020","title":"Design Studio II","description":"This studio explores urban architecture as an embodiment of cultural values.

While not all works of art are universal, they share a universal quality, namely, the need to be perceived as the authentic expression of the artists’ experience.\" —Lebbeus Woods\n\nOut of the many emotions and attitudes humans experience in the world, landscape architecture tends to concern itself with a particularly optimistic subset: happiness, excitement, productivity, fitness, \"grit,\" awareness, playfulness, community. Other territories of the emotional landscape, intense and profoundly human though they might be, can feel taboo: sadness, anger, desire, despair, love, resentment, guilt, confusion, loneliness. Why should this be so, in a world that increasingly confronts us with existential challenges?\n\n\"Landscape Existentialism\" will be a focused design seminar in which we will practice engaging with these other emotions. We will do a little bit of reading and watch a few movies to hint at possible existential landscapes; and then students will develop small design proposals, at sites of their choosing, in full engagement with conditions of emotional intensity. We will discuss our ideas and proposals together, throughout the semester; and in the end, the proposals will be presented as a small ensemble. Our ultimate intent is to provide a supportive and free space to work with depths of feeling and kinds of human engagement that lie outside the familiar psychic terrain of conventional academic and professional landscape design; and to experiment with a more emotionally honest working method than is usually allowed by the forces that structure our design labor.\n","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LARP-7800","title":"Topics Theory & Design","description":"These advanced seminars explore advanced ideas in contemporary landscape architectural design and theory.

CDR refers to a set of technologies and land-use management strategies designed to capture atmospheric carbon and sequester it in biological, geological, or marine sinks. Proponents suggest that CDR serves as a link between the earth and sky, offering architects, landscape architects, and planners with a new entry-point to confront the climate crisis. Critics, however, argue that CDR merely provides a speculative “fix” for the oil and gas sector, effectively transforming land into a sacrifice zone for governments and  corporations seeking to offset greenhouse gas emissions permitted under the logics of net-zero decarbonization. Through a series of critical readings, weekly discussions, and iterative mapping exercises, students will investigate the expanded geographies of labour, capital, materials, and ecological flows implicated in terrestrial strategies of atmospheric carbon management. Ultimately, this seminar seeks to critique ecomodernist decarbonization agendas by foregrounding the reciprocal interrelationships between humans, the earth, and the atmosphere. It asks: how can designers reveal the complex—and often contradictory—values present in CDR landscapes, and make them legible to diverse audiences with a stake in the future? How can design facilitate a shared understanding of place in debates surrounding the low-carbon transition, and help guide the production of just and inclusive climate futures?","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-5990","title":"500 Technology Lab","description":"A required lab/workshop to accompany the core technology sequence in the March program.

It carries a complex meaning in art and architecture involving both the ability to make a drawing and the intellectual capacity to invent a design. These two activities have been considered linked from Renaissance times on, and for good reason. Drawing is one of humanity’s oldest cultural achievements, and along with music began at least thirty-five thousand years ago, long before any written language. Robert Adams has remarked that the only thing new in art is the example. Progress (if there is such a thing) is not cumulative or additive in art as in medicine, science, and technology but one of personal increased sensibility, perception, expression, and performance. One strives to rise to the heightened level and awareness of the greatest artists, performers, and designers of the past. This class will emphasize the practice of looking and seeing the world and its visual phenomena more carefully and responding, while examining the record of others’ efforts to do so.  Drawing is more about seeing and thinking than it is about wriggling the wrist or dexterity. Sketching and drawing is a way of discovering and knowing, of slowing oneself down long enough to perceive something carefully, to analyze and think about it – literally of being present. It is also a tool for speculation and exploration, for representing new possible physical situations and examining things that don’t exist (yet). It is free, doesn’t require electric power, is portable, flexible, personal, and strangely satisfying.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-5320","title":"Construction II","description":"A continuation of Construction I, focusing on light and heavy steel frame construction, concrete construction, light and heavyweight cladding systems and systems building.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.38,"instructor_quality":3.69,"difficulty":1.85,"work_required":1.92,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-5120","title":"History and Theory II","description":"How do architecture, urbanism, and the environment reflect the dominant social,economic, and political changes of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and how did its vast geopolitical shifts such as Imperialism, Fascism, the Cold War, Neoliberalism, the \"War on Terror,\" and Nationalism reshape architecture culture? How might architecture culture respond and help construct its resistant variants, anti-fascism, anti-imperialism, decolonization, and making \"quieter places\" in Donna Haraway's sense? How do critical frameworks to rethink positivism, efficiency, standardization, and even utopian thinking become revised through the lenses of queer, postcolonial, critical race, and eco-feminist theory in postwar architectural production?

Due to the specific scale that furniture occupies, however, this physical form relates not only to the environment in which the furniture is set, but also intimately to the physical bodies that interact with and around it. Additionally, as a manufactured product, often specified in large quantities, furniture must also address not only poetic considerations, but practical and economic ones as well. Instead of being seen as one-off objects, the furniture created in this seminar focuses on furniture development as a strategic design process where the designer's role is to understand the various responsibilities to each stakeholder (client/manufacturer, market/customer, environment) and the additional considerations (materials, processes, manufacturability, etc.), and ultimately translate these points into a potentially successful product. In order to approach furniture in this manner, the course will be structured around specific design briefs and clustered into three distinct but continuous stages. First, through focused research into stakeholder needs and potential market opportunities, students will craft tailored design proposals and development concepts accordingly. Next, students will work toward  visualizing a concept, complete with sketches, small mock-ups, scale- model prototypes, technical drawings, connections and other pertinent details in order to refine their proposals and secure a real world understanding of the manufacturing processes and the potential obstacles created by their decisions. From insights gained and feedback from these steps, students will ultimately develop a final design proposal for a piece, collection, or system of furniture that successfully leverages their understanding of a thoughtful and deliberate design strategy.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-7370","title":"Semi-Fictitious Realms\t","description":"The pursuit of immersive digital experiences has long been a goal of the computing industry. Early wearable displays designed in the 1960s depicted simple three-dimensional graphics in ways that had never been seen before. Through trial and error, digital pioneers reframed the relationship between user and machine, and over the last ﬁve decades, have made strides that advanced both the input and output mechanisms we are so comfortable with today. As a ﬁeld, architecture has been reliant on these advancements to design and document buildings, but these tools still leave the architect removed from the physicality of the design, with their work depicted as 2D lines or 3D planes alone. This course will study the evolutionary advancements made that now allow us to fully inhabit digital worlds through Virtual Reality.

For many, the Italian historian's dismissal of \"hopes in design\" under conditions of advanced capitalism produced a disciplinary impasse. This in turn led to call to oublier Tafuri - to move beyong his pessimistic and lacerating stance. The seminar will undertake a close reading of one of Tafuri's most complexly conceived and richly elaborated books, The Sphere and the Labyrinth: Avant-Gardes and Architecture form Piranesi to the 1970s. Initially published in Italian in 1980 and translated into English in 1987, the book represents the first effort to define and historicize the concept of an avant-garde specifically in architecture. Its content centers on the radical formal and urban experiments of the first three decades of the twentieth century. Yet Tafuri surprisingly begins his account with the eighteenth-century inventions of Piranesi, and he concludes with an examination of the \"neo-avant-garde\" of his own day. In addition to traversing The Sphere and the Labyrinth chapter by chapter - starting with the extraordinary methodological introduction, \"The Historical 'Project'\"-we shall  also read a number of primary and secondary sources on the historical contexts under discussion and consider a number of important intertexts that shed light on Tafuri's position. The objectives of the course are at once historical and historiographic: we shall we shall be concerned both with actual events and with how they have been written into history. Finally, we shall reassess the role of an avant-garde in architecture and compare Tafuri's conception to that advanced in other disciplines. Is the concept of an avant-garde still viable today? Or should it be consigned to the dustbin of twentieth-century ideas? Assignment for first class: read the introduction to The Sphere and the Labyrinth, pp. 1-21, \"The Historical 'Project.'\" A copy of the book is on reserve at the library. Note: the book is out of print. For future classes please make every effort to purchase a used copy or obtain one via interlibrary loan.

The dissemination and consumption of information through images through all types of media platforms influence and re-define (for better or worse) all aspects of our culture and reality. It is vital to develop a deep knowledge of the current visual concepts and techniques in arts, photography, cinema, product design and architecture to claim a critical stance through which we can positively contribute to the evolution of contemporary culture. The discipline of architecture has been deeply influenced by the digital shift in modes of design and visualization which yielded a wide array of directions within the architectural discourse, especially with questions and problems regarding representation. One clear outcome of this transformational period is the diversity of new representational strategies to seek alternative modes of visualization. It is clear that no one representational medium can be defined as the locus of architectural thought and architecture, as a cultural practice, can no longer be defined through the output of a single medium. The reality of our discipline is that we work through collective mediums  and conventions of drawings, models, images, simulations, texts, prototypes and buildings to visualize architectural concepts. These mediums all require degrees of expertise in techniques that are necessary for their execution: they all involve conceptual depth that define their disciplinary positions; they all require translations across each other to enable subjective work-flows; they all require aesthetic attitudes to influence the development of visual culture in architecture. This course will introduce the AAD majors to contemporary topics of visualization in arts, photography, cinema and architecture. They will explore multiple mediums of representation to help them gain the vital visual literacy to excel in the program. Students will be introduced to discursive background and contemporary concepts of line drawing, fabricated object and constructed image as they work through 3 distinct projects during the semester. Each exercise will be initiated by a topical lecture and be followed by weekly pin ups to advance student projects.

Deployed effectively, laws can make environments healthier and instigate healthier behavior. But law doesn’t work automatically let alone universally. Few laws are enforceable at scale. Instead, people often must choose to comply with legal prescriptions, and that is far from certain. Driver use of phones, for example, remains widespread despite bans. The effect of laws depends in important ways on social context and on other factors, explaining why the same law can simultaneously benefit some while harming others. A law requiring bicycle helmets can reduce head trauma while increasing racialized policing. Successful implementation of laws relies on societal trust and on credibility, which are finite, meaning that overuse of law can undermine its efficacy both for a particular purpose but also more broadly. This class explores the use of law as an interventional tool. Assigned reading and discussion will be organized around different mechanisms through which law is thought to change behavior (e.g., deterrence, signaling) and around different subjects of legal intervention (e.g., reduction of road fatalities, pandemic response). There are two overarching goals for the semester. The first is to development a practical skillset to determine whether legal intervention is appropriate to address a particular problem and, if so, how to define and evaluate its implementation. The second is to develop a deeper understanding of the role of law in the public health toolset and in a healthy society more broadly.

This course explores the major auteurs, styles, themes, and currents of the so-called \"New Korean Cinema\" that emerged in the mid-to-late 1990s to continue to this day. Drawing from texts on critical film and Korean studies, we will pay particular attention to how the selected works re-present, resist, and interweave the sociopolitical climate they concern and are born out of. Using cinema as a lens with which to see the society, we will touch upon major events of the twentieth century including national division, military dictatorship and democratization movements, IMF economic crisis, youth culture, hallyu (the Korean wave), and damunhwa (multiculturalism initiative). In so doing, we will closely examine how each cinematic medium addresses the societal power structure and the role of the \"Other\" it represents in terms of class, race, gender, and sexuality in the construction of contemporary Korean society.

Health capability is the ability to be healthy; it integrates health functioning and health agency. Health capability helps us understand the conditions that facilitate and barriers that impede health and the ability to make healthy choices. Health capabilities are key strengths resulting from individual and societal commitment of human, financial, and physical resources with the goal of helping people thrive. Differences in health capability explain why, for example, personal skills and determination or health beliefs are not enough to achieve health, why people with even the best external conditions can still have poor health, and why a narrow biomedical model of disease is insufficient. Health capability captures the dynamic, interactive, multidimensionality of health and flourishing. Health capability has the effect of creating a virtuous circle; developing people's health capability enables them to create and support the conditions for their own and other's health capability and so forth. It offers an evaluation of the aim and success of public policies in terms of people's lived experiences. The course is motivated by the idea that health capabilities ought to be a primary dimension in which equity in health and public policy is sought. The course includes three parts. The first part engages with the health capability model. The second part examines the health capability profile. The third part explores health capability applications.

In the same vein, volunteers are the atoms of voluntary action. Volunteers are the backbone of many human service organizations, environmental organizations, and other nonprofit organizations. Volunteers serve almost every function from stuffing envelopes to sitting on boards of nonprofit organizations. They make many programs such as education, and environmental protection possible and fill the void created by the fiscally retreating governments as well as newly arising social problems and human needs. Without volunteer participation, the services that are offered by many nonprofit organizations would be unavailable or provided at a higher cost to government, clients, and donors. The literature as to what constitutes volunteering and what produces committed and effective volunteers is confusing and full of contradictions. Furthermore, only few organizations know how to face the challenges of managing unpaid staff and how to motivate volunteers without offering material benefits. Volunteers are simultaneously non-remunerated employees and independent support with a different agency than paid employees. This course will combine presentations, group work, discussions, case studies, video clips, and readings to delve into the challenges of volunteering.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GPRD-9630","title":"Oral Comp Exam IIi","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GPRD-9570","title":"Perio Case Prese Vi","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GPRS-9410","title":"Adv Clin Prosth Vi","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GPRD-9740","title":"Perio-Pros Case Viii","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"GPRD-9750","title":"Adv Topics Perio Viii","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"NPLD-5830","title":"Soc Impact Measurement","description":"The twofold purpose of social impact measurement is to assess and improve the impact of nonprofit programs and to offer actionable information for ongoing improvement.

As charitable giving is on the rise, nonprofit professionals are thinking more strategically about securing charitable gifts that will position their organization to have greater social benefit, whether they represent small grassroots organizations or large institutions. This course will provide students with the theory and basic knowledge of fundraising that charitable organizations use to raise private philanthropic dollars. The course will begin with an overview of the philanthropic landscape and key trends in philanthropy to contextualize the role of fundraising. Each subsequent module will review different aspects of the theory and body of knowledge that guides the most effective fundraising programs in charitable organizations, including principles of individual giving, major gifts, structural philanthropic vehicles, making the case for support, prospect research, and engaging volunteer leaders in fundraising. Modules are structured to both impart theory and develop skills to enhance students' critical analysis of philanthropy.

Aspiring leaders of big social change rarely succeed in engaging others in a meaningful or comprehensive way, their passion and their knowledge reaching hundreds or thousands when millions more could benefit. There are exceptions to this pattern, however, and this course seeks to explain what sets apart the initiatives that become successful large- scale movements. These efforts reliably address three questions in order to have a big impact: 1.How can we secure a genuine commitment from others to join us in the hard work ahead? 2.How can we set a strategy that gives us leverage and reach, making the most of our finite resources? 3. How can we take action, day in and day out, in such a way that we meet our aims for growth and impact, optimizing rapid learning and improvement by everyone in our movement? Drawing on examples from around the world and across the social sector, this course will walk you through these questions and provide you with a blueprint for spreading ideas, innovations, and programs that work, allowing you to engage the most people possible to change behavior and social outcomes at scale.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"CHEM-2412","title":"Organic Chemistry I Lab","description":"Lab for CHEM 2411: Principles of Organic Chemistry I with Laboratory","semester":"2023A","num_sections":4,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"SWRK-7860","title":"Trauma in Practice","description":"This course integrates trauma theory and practice and expands practice knowledge to include the treatment and assessment of the survivors of trauma.

The course focuses on postwar U.S. cities (Chicago and other Midwestern/ Northeast rust belt cities in particular), though a number of readings explore these issues in broader contexts. As a way to further understand postwar US urbanism, we will expand our focus briefly to the geopolitical/international scale during the weeks on neoliberalism and microfinance.  Urban political economy refers to different theoretical traditions within the social sciences that explain urban development in terms of the relationship between markets, states, and community actors (or, civil society). Part I of the course covers four different theories of modern political economy: Neoclassical, Keynesian, Marxian, and Neoliberal. Our purpose is to provide a framework for political economic analysis and an historical foundation for understanding postwar transformation. Part II of the course grounds the foundational material of Part I by tracing the economic and political forces that have shaped post-war urban development trends in Northeastern and Midwestern cities (especially Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and NY). Particular attention will be given to issues such as race, suburbanization, deindustrialization, welfare state retrenchment, gentrification, and public housing transformation.

It ranges therefore, from epistemology and philosophy of mind to ethics and political philosophy. For instance: What is the nature of learning and teaching? How is it possible to come to know something we did not know already--and how can we aid others in doing that? How, if at all, should formal institutions of education be concerned with shaping students' moral and civic character? What is the proper relation between educational institutions and the state? We also ask questions more specific to our own time and context. For example: how, in a multicultural state, should we educate students of varied social identities, like race, gender, and religion?

From a country of emigration to other parts of the world, Italy became—as many historians, geographers, and scholars have observed—an immigration site, playing a pivotal role in the African diaspora. In the shadow of Italy’s colonialist heritage (a past that Italy still has not fully confronted), these phenomena of mass migration challenge, complicate, and develop the notion of Italian-ness and undermine the fixity of an Italian identity in favor of multicultural and transnational identities. This course focuses on several Black Italian artists, writers, filmmakers, and activists of Somali, Eritrean, Tunisian, Ethiopian, and Egyptian origins (e.g. migrants or children of immigrants who were born or raised in Italy and children of mixed-race unions) who contribute to broaden the definition of Italian-ness and to challenge its racial, social, and cultural boundaries.

Diplomacy","description":"The Trump Presidency has profoundly shifted America's role in the world and the way in which key institutions of foreign policy making are staffed and positioned to advance America's interests. The ascent of extreme nationalists and nationalism in other power centers in the world along with growing distrust in government and public institutions may have marked the close of the two-decade post 9/11 era. Indeed, the global COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which actors across the international spectrum have responded (or failed to respond) has led many to question the assumptions inherent in the post-9/11 international order and has marked the beginning of a new era of competition, a return to great-power politics, and the diminishing power of traditional actors, systems, and ideals on the global stage. This course will provide students with an in-depth, practical analysis of foreign policy and foreign policy making, with a view from Washington. It will also provide a baseline global literacy, through the lens of emerging ideas, institutions, interests, and actors, and focus on a framework for understanding shifts already underway in how Washington views the world. We will utilize less traditional resources, and instead focus on practical and \"real-world\" course material as well as less traditional instruction methods - utilizing and  analyzing the sources and resources that policy makers in Washington rely upon.

Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government.

On the one hand, the sociopolitical formation of race constituted black and brown bodies in juxtaposition to the logics of reason that the instruments of post-Enlightenment technicity were built. On the other hand, as Wendy Chun argues, the discursive formation of race was a technology in and of itself that was designed to hierarchize and differentiate bodies as well as to make black and brown bodies extracted technologies for labor and Capital. This seminar will explore this deeply enmeshed history between race and technology by engaging text in the history of science and philosophy, critical theories of technology, cybernetics, and critical theories of difference. These text will range in topics from the transparent subject to surveillance studies to algorithmic bias to the speculative fiction of Afrofuturism.

Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government. Policy makers have to take these phenomena into account in order to design a good income support system.\nCourse does not fulfill MSW Policy requirement","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"MSSP-6310","title":"Law and Social Policy","description":"This course introduces students to the basics of the American legal system, focusing on the interplay between litigation and social policy.

This course specifically utilizes the term reproductive justice. As Ross & Solinger (2017) describe, the definition of reproductive justice intentionally moves beyond the pro-choice/pro-life perspectives of policies regulating abortion and focuses policy assessment through core principles of 1) the right not to have a child, 2) the right to have a child, 3) the right to parent children in a safe and healthy environment, and 4) sexual autonomy and gender freedom for every human being.

Immigration","description":"From the 1790 Act that restricted the right of naturalization to “free whites,” to the quota Acts of the 1920s that limited the entry of non-Nordic immigrants, to the reinvigorated restrictionism of the post-9/11 era, the laws of the nation and the discourses of immigration and immigrants that have enabled them have been key terrains in and through which legitimate and de-legitimized identities have been forged, and populations demarcated as viable participants in society or as undesirable Others to be excluded from full participation. Because immigration has been a central discriminating mechanism through which this selective peopling of the nation has been accomplished, the history of immigration and immigrants is a site par excellence for the examination of the mechanisms through which to examine contemporary issues of diversity, “difference,” and marginalization of populations. Social work’s development as a profession coincided with the period in U.S. history marked by the largest waves of immigration. The strategies the early U.S. social workers and social reformers devised to improve the poor and their communities were interventions located in and focused on immigrants and their neighborhoods. Work with poor immigrants in urban settings, shaped the nature and the direction of social work in these crucial early years of the profession. Moreover, in this work with the largely white immigrants—formulated and accomplished in the context of the rapidly developing social and physical sciences—social work cut its teeth, not only on the abiding issues of race, heredity, and culture, but on the still contested links between the individual and the environment. Examining the history of immigration—the history of the organic past which has constructed the particular demographic make-up of the present-day communities—is indispensable to understanding the profession’s current practices and future aspirations. This seminar will examine the socio-legal history of immigration. We will review major U.S. legislation concerning immigrants and immigration, refugees and asylum, and citizenship and naturalization. The legal codes, as well as the political and social discourses of identity that undergird and enabled those codes, will be analyzed through the lens of poststructuralist theories.\nMSW Policy Option","semester":"2023A","num_sections":0,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"SWRK-7540","title":"Play Therapy","description":"Play is the method children use to master and understand their worlds.

This workshop will explore fiction and creative nonfiction using nontraditional techniques including nonlinear segments, multiple voices, found texts, and more. Students will dig into readings from a wide range of sources, from Sei Shōnagon’s 10th-century Pillow Book through contemporary works such as Jenny Offill’s Weather, and will write weekly responses to those readings. Every week, students will produce their own original creative work using a number of narrative collage techniques discussed in class, and will have the opportunity to revise and polish their own writing. Lively peer feedback is required in the form of discussion boards. Additionally, there will be optional Zoom workshops for live discussion and sharing creative work.\nCourse offered by Penn LPS Online.

Every social service agency utilizes groups, and social workers will engage with a variety of groups during the course of their careers. Given the fact that collective group processes are especially salient for marginalized communities, group work is essential to direct practice that is embedded in the principles of social justice. Moreover, group work has been shown to be a superior form of intervention for clients battling chronic conditions, entrenched behaviors and social stigma. In an era of evidence-based practice, successful and cost-effective group skills are a vital component of every social worker’s toolkit. Students will learn about different types of groups and modalities, facilitate groups in class and in field settings, and engage with social workers who have implemented group interventions in various communities in diverse contexts. The class will train students to facilitate therapeutic, psychoeducational, task, and decision groups, while helping them to explore how to start, manage and terminate groups in various social work settings.\nMSW Clinical Track elective, Macro Track elective, Policy Option","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ANEL-4600","title":"Middle Egyptian Texts","description":"This course will deal with those texts of the Middle Kingdom that are written in the classical form of the language.

Recent years have seen a growing movement to bring more science to how we manage people. In some cases, that means ensuring that whatever practices and approaches we adopt are backed up by solid evidence as to their effectiveness. Often, organizations will seek to go further, analyzing their own data to identify problems and learn what is working and what is not in their own context. This course applies the insights of the people analytics movement to help students become better managers and more critical analysts within their organizations.

The first few sessions explore the basic building blocks of the career, outlining our knowledge on the different orientations that individuals take to their careers, how approaches to the career change as people get older, and how different kinds of job moves within and across firms advance careers. We will complement academic research by also hearing from an experienced executive who can talk about the issues that she dealt with as her career unfolded, and how she approached major decisions. The second part of the course explores in more detail the social resources that affect careers. Much research has examined how the structure of social networks affect success in the workplace and access to job. We will review this evidence with an eye to understanding how effective relationships can be developed. We will also examine some of the most critical relationships for shaping careers - those involving mentors and sponsors. The third section of the course then examines a number of the most important and difficult issues affecting modern careers. We explore one of the most difficult transitions that forms part of many careers, moving into management from an individual contributor role. We will also explore important social psychological conditions and strategies that allow individuals to persist and succeed in their career pursuit, especially in the face of obstacles, such as career setbacks and employer rejections. We then turn to issues of gender and careers. There is much evidence on the particular challenges that have faced women managers and executives in moving up the corporate ladder. We examine that evidence and discuss possible responses by managers and by organizations. We also discuss how individuals and organizations can manage the challenges of balancing work and personal life throughout the career.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":0,"course_quality":3.55,"instructor_quality":3.65,"difficulty":1.185,"work_required":2.11,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LSMP-4210","title":"Lsmp Capstone","description":"LSMP Capstone course","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.487,"instructor_quality":3.387,"difficulty":3.701,"work_required":3.818,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"CIMS-2083","title":"Faking it in Lit and Film","description":"Deception and lies are a constant theme and a mechanism of narrative art.

However, though science fiction films have long been reliable box office earners and cult phenomena, critical acknowledgement and analysis was slow to develop. Still, few genres reflect the sensibility of their age so transparently—if often unconsciously—or provide so many opportunities for filmmakers to simultaneously address social issues and expand the lexicon with new technologies. Given budgetary considerations and the appetite for franchises, science fiction auteurs face a difficult negotiation between artistic expression and lowest common denominator imperatives, the controversy over Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (1985) being perhaps the most infamous example. Nevertheless, many notable filmmakers have done their most perceptive and influential work in the scifi realm, including Gilliam, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, Paul Verhoeven, James Cameron and Alfonso Cuaron. This course will survey the scope of contemporary science fiction cinema, after looking first at seminal works like Metropolis (1927) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that continue to cast their shadow over the genre. We will then devote considerable time to a pair of more modern films, Scott’s Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), which drew from earlier movements (German expressionism, noir), influenced new ones (cyberpunk) and inspired a rare wave of academic discourse. Over the course of the term we will sample smaller, more independent-minded projects, such as Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Spike Jonze’s Her (2013) as well as higher profile but much more risky epics from filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-6360","title":"Material Formations","description":"Material Formations introduces robotic production and material dynamics as active agents in design rationalization and expression.

The afterlives of Capital, however, took disparate forms across different regions and traditions globally: while working on the same text, these traditions gave rise to conflicting and contradictory interpretations, antagonistic dialogues, and cross-disciplinary encounters. This seminar will examine a series of exemplary interpretations of Capital with attention to detail in order to clarify the stakes of different readings and pose the question of relevance of Marx’s masterpiece for the contemporary moment. We will investigate how political conjunctures, regional specificities, and ideological concerns shape disparate modes and cultures of reading. We will also examine how Capital is transfigured through the lens of disciplines such as literary studies and comparative literature, philosophy, political science, postcolonial studies, and economics. We will also pose the question of philosophical genealogies of Capital, tracing how divergent philosophical backgrounds inflect the reconfigurations of Marx’s thought, e.g., in examining “Hegelian,” “Spinozist,” and “Epicurian” readings. The topics may include, but are not limited to, the following regions and traditions: France (Louis Althusser group), Italy (Mario Tronti and autonomia tradition), and Germany (Neue Marx Lektüre); Soviet Union (Isaak Rubin, Evald Ilyenkov); Bolivia (Alvaro Garcia Linera), and Argentina (Ernesto Laclau).

The afterlives of Capital, however, took disparate forms across different regions and traditions globally: while working on the same text, these traditions gave rise to conflicting and contradictory interpretations, antagonistic dialogues, and cross-disciplinary encounters. This seminar will examine a series of exemplary interpretations of Capital with attention to detail in order to clarify the stakes of different readings and pose the question of relevance of Marx’s masterpiece for the contemporary moment. We will investigate how political conjunctures, regional specificities, and ideological concerns shape disparate modes and cultures of reading. We will also examine how Capital is transfigured through the lens of disciplines such as literary studies and comparative literature, philosophy, political science, postcolonial studies, and economics. We will also pose the question of philosophical genealogies of Capital, tracing how divergent philosophical backgrounds inflect the reconfigurations of Marx’s thought, e.g., in examining “Hegelian,” “Spinozist,” and “Epicurian” readings. The topics may include, but are not limited to, the following regions and traditions: France (Louis Althusser group), Italy (Mario Tronti and autonomia tradition), and Germany (Neue Marx Lektüre); Soviet Union (Isaak Rubin, Evald Ilyenkov); Bolivia (Alvaro Garcia Linera), and Argentina (Ernesto Laclau).

The cost of such crises for citizens, pensioners, and bond holders can be significant. We seek to understand the underlying economic, political, and legal/regulatory causes of such events so that they may be prevented in the future. The importance of private information and public regulation for disciplining the fiscal performance of democratically elected governments will be a central concern.

We will discuss the challenges faced by founders in different global contexts, the components of a robust institutional ecosystem, and the ways in which creative solutions may flourish in response to local problems. Along the way, students will gain a virtual view into global startup communities, and personalized insights from firm founders operating around the world - from Bogota to Nairobi to Jakarta. The course will be structured in three primary parts. The first and longest section will discuss the Key Challenges for emerging firm growth across the globe, such as access to talent and resources, political risk, and legal institutions. The second section will highlight particularly active areas of Context-Driven Innovation that are thriving in various regions, such as financial technology, mobile health products, and clean energy.

This course is intended for graduate students with a background in either the social sciences (economics, political science, law, or policy) or who are in STEM programs (science and engineering). This course will complement the material covered in the Kleinman Center Introduction to Energy Policy course (ENMG 5020) taught in the fall. It will be an opportunity to learn from one another and build a holistic understanding of the technical and policy dimensions of the energy transition and the global response to climate change and environmental degradation. The course will be broken into three chapters. For the first third of the semester, we will focus on basics of policy and engineering literacy, with each student bringing their own expertise to the table.

The middle third of this course will be built around case studies of grand societal challenges; some of which have seen considerable progress towards being solved, others which are still the subject of great uncertainty and disagreement. Among other topics, this course will explore: The impact of sweeping standards on building and appliance efficiency; the rapid development and mutual reinforcement of renewable energy technologies and policy; the ability of policy to facilitate healthy competition between technologies (hydrogen vs batteries, for example); The allocation of scarce CCUS resources to abate difficult to decarbonize products like cement, steel, and plastics;  the importance of grid regulation and market design in ensuring future energy reliability and affordability; and the need for transition-ready environmental policies that protect ecosystems and communities without hindering access to critical resources (metals, minerals, land, etc.)  The final third of the semester will be structured largely around group projects for which students with diverse expertise will work together to identify a grand societal challenge and isolate the technical and policy barriers to solving this challenge. These groups will give regular updates to the rest of the class and will work towards making a meaningful contribution to solving their challenge through collaborative problem solving, design, and research.

This course is intended for graduate students with a background in either the social sciences (economics, political science, law, or policy) or who are in STEM programs (science and engineering). This course will complement the material covered in the Kleinman Center Introduction to Energy Policy course (ENMG 5020) taught in the fall. It will be an opportunity to learn from one another and build a holistic understanding of the technical and policy dimensions of the energy transition and the global response to climate change and environmental degradation. The course will be broken into three chapters. For the first third of the semester, we will focus on basics of policy and engineering literacy, with each student bringing their own expertise to the table.

Mindfulness-based approaches provide students with powerful tools for growth, learning, and connecting with others. The class provides a comprehensive overview of the practice and science of mindfulness-based stress management and mindfulness meditation. Students in the course will receive extensive training in a variety of mindfulness-based meditation practices and approaches. Mindfulness-based strategies will be used to manage stress, cope with challenge, facilitate learning, improve patient care, cultivate leadership, and enhance relationships. At the end of the course, students will have a powerful set of meditation-based tools that they can adapt to meet their own personal and professional goals. Didactic content includes the neuroscience of meditation, the social, interpersonal and psychological aspects of health and healing, and the relationship between mindfulness and positive psychology. Each class will include mindfulness-based exercises and practices. Because it takes a significant amount of time to learn to use mindfulness effectively, students will need to make a commitment to practice mindfulness meditation for 30 minutes every day throughout the semester. Components of the class include: A Tuesday evening plenary session from 6:00 pm - 8:30 pm. Medical students have the option to begin on September 16. We expect that this session will be offered online. Wednesday small group sessions, you may choose either 3:00 pm - 4:30 pm, or 5:30 - 7:00 pm. A virtual mindfulness retreat on Sunday, November 15. The retreat is a required part of the course; an alternative retreat is offered on Sunday, November 8. If you are not a student in the Perelman School of Medicine a permit is required to register for the course. To request a permit email: mindfulness@uphs.upenn.edu.

We will pay close attention to how these poets represent China’s place in the world, as well as the role of language in social change. Topics of discussion include: national identity, revolution, translation, gender, the body, ethnicity, and technology. Familiarity with Chinese or related cultural context is beneficial, but not required. This course introduces students to Chinese poetry in English translation. Students will leave the course with an in-depth understanding of the main figures, themes, and techniques of Chinese poetry, and will be introduced to some of the major developments in the history of China. Through a focus on primary texts, students will develop the vocabulary and analytical skills to appreciate and analyze poetry in translation and will gain confidence as writers thinking about literary texts.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9620","title":"Patent Law-Appellate Advocacy","description":"tbd","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-7122","title":"Topics in Arch Theory II","description":"A seminar on advanced topics in architectural design and theory.

Topics and instructors will vary.\nThis theory seminar focuses on architectural envelopes: building surfaces that perform climatically and / or structurally, while using technology, materials and their assembly to expressive ends. Such envelopes may be culturally meaningful when conveying a society’s relationship to place, to climate, to art, to technology or to tradition. Adopting a topical approach, the seminar examines the theoretical questions that emerge from the applications of technologies and the varying degrees of their exposure in envelopes. It identifies architectural principles in case studies from around the world, from the 19th to the 21st century, built in a range of techniques and materials. Lectures topics include: Structure, Construction, Tectonics, “Skin and Bones”, Masking, Integration, Delamination, Situating Technology, “Structural” and Power-operated approaches to Climatic Mediation, Green Technologies, Material Transformations, Cultivated Materials, Discreteness. All topics link historic and 21st century considerations, with the environmental and cultural impact of specific technologies. The seminar develops students’ critical thinking towards contemporary practice, where understanding the reciprocities between construction, technology and expression is essential for creatively tackling architecture’s impact on the environment and sustaining its civic agency.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9050","title":"Psychology of Legal Decision","description":"Psychology of Legal Decision-Making","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9320","title":"Sharswood Seminar","description":"Sharswood Seminar","semester":"2023A","num_sections":2,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"ARCH-7360","title":"Tech Designated Elective","description":"Several sections are offered from which students make a selection.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9610","title":"Public Defense Topics","description":"TBD","semester":"2023A","num_sections":0,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9270","title":"Tax Policy","description":"","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9770","title":"Strategic Transactions","description":"Strategic Transactions in the Fashion and Retail Industry","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LARP-7803","title":"Topics Theory & Design","description":"These advanced seminars explore advanced ideas in contemporary landscape architectural design and theory.

Our aim is to explore the potential roles and tools of design as a means of responding to risk in spatial, infrastructural and policy projects for resilience at a variety of scales. \nIn collaboration with faculty, students and thinkers in other disciplines, we will develop a body of knowledge about risk and how it relates to streams of intellectual energy around resilience, and we will identify design tools and strategies to manage both climate risks and project risks. We will use the research seminar to collectively scope the openings where design can have the greatest agency (in either reducing risk or leveraging the potential for change that risk and instability create).

Sufi philosophies, liturgical practices, and social organizations have been a major part of the Islamic tradition in all historical periods, and Sufism has also served as a primary muse behind Islamic aesthetic expression in poetry, music, and the visual arts. In this course, we will explore the various significations of Sufism by addressing both the world of ideas and socio-cultural practices. The course is divided into three broad sections: central themes and concepts going back to the earliest individuals who identified themselves as Sufis; Sufi metaphysics and epistemology as exemplified in the work of Ibn al-'Arabi and his school, and literary expressions as exemplified in the epic poem Layla and Majnun by Nizami, The Conference of the Birds by Attar, and in the life and poetry of Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi. In studying this material, we will be concerned equally with establishing common patterns and seeing how being a Sufi has meant different things to various people over the course of history.","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":3.426,"instructor_quality":3.643,"difficulty":2.893,"work_required":2.873,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9520","title":"Intellectual Property Trans","description":"Intellectual Property Transactions","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9060","title":"Crimmigration","description":"Crimmigration","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-6750","title":"Real Estate Finance","description":"Real Estate Finance","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9360","title":"Corporate Governance","description":"Corporate Governance","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-9800","title":"Corruption & Corporate Crimes","description":"Corruption, Fraud, and Corporate Crimes","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"LAW-7380","title":"Structured Finance","description":"Structured Finance and Securitization","semester":"2023A","num_sections":1,"course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"recommendation_score":null},{"id":"SWRK-7550","title":"Intntnl Swrk Glbl South","description":"This interdisciplinary course will introduce students to social policy and practice perspectives from outside the U.S. and especially from communities in the Global South.

These social enterprises, known as ‘Base of the Pyramid’ (BoP) ventures, seek to simultaneously achieve profits, scale, and social impact. This course will focus on a sector that has been radically transformed by BoP ventures over the last decade – clean energy. Not only has this sector been catalytic to delivering energy access across the developing world, it also directly aims to combat climate change, the existential issue of our age. This is a course for those who are interested in becoming social entrepreneurs, particularly in developing countries. It will reveal the nuances of operationalizing these ventures and provide a business toolkit for designing and launching a social venture. The course will equally be topical for those who are simply interested in better understanding the inner-workings and implications of this fast-growing and alluring model of alleviating poverty and disease.\nTravel course to Kenya.

We consider how health advocates contribute to forming personal identities around certain illnesses and conditions, how they mobilize constituents and recruit allies, and how they influence decisions about health policy, research, and practice. We also consider the implications of an increasingly professionalized health advocacy industry and ask how corporate sponsorship has changed the landscape of health activism.

Historic and collective trauma – from the injustices of colonialism, slavery, war, dispossession, genocide, and ecocide – often involves multiple, interconnected scales of harm, and accordingly demands responses that consider multiple forms of healing. Forms of repair might include the restoration of a local ecosystem, the establishment of an archive, the preservation of a building or street, legal acknowledgement of heirs, the transfer of property rights, or the repatriation of artworks.\nThis course will consider these interdisciplinary approaches and strategies of redemption through both readings and case studies. Case studies will be international in scope and will focus on the ways in which an engaged approach to history can inform responses through landscape, community activism, architecture, monuments, artworks, exhibitions, or archives.\nStudents are not required to have a background in architecture, and students from different disciplinary backgrounds and interests are encouraged to participate. One of the goals of this course is to explore how architectural, urban planning, and landscape approaches to reparations offer forms of knowledge that are productive for other fields.

By embracing these longstanding entanglements, this course will explore the means by which Hebrew scribes came to define this deity not only as the most important god among many, but as the only all-powerful deity to exist in the entire cosmos. A variety of topics will be covered, addressing a number of questions raised by the evidence at hand: what is the evidence for Yhwh outside of the Bible? How do historians define his emergence in history? Did he really have a wife named Asherah? What did he look like and where did he live?\nWhat circumstances caused Judean writers to consider him the only all-powerful deity the universe?

So Utopian are we that we go the length of believing that the Revolution can and ought to assure shelter, food, and clothes to all...\" -Pyotr Kropotkin, The Conquest of Bread. Although born in the West through the works of William Godwin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, anarchism as a political theory was subsequently developed by a variety of Russian and Ukrainian theorists and activists, including Mikhail Bakunin, Lev Tolstoy, Pyotr Kropotkin, Nestor Makhno, and Emma Goldman (in exile in the United States). Anarchism fundamentally questions the need for political power and authority, particularly as embodied in a state. As a political theory, anarchism makes moral claims about the importance of individual liberty and presents a positive theory of human flourishing that is based on ideals of non-coercive consensus building. This course investigates the 19th century theoretical foundations of Russian and Ukrainian anarchist theory through a close examination of key texts from the 19th and early 20th centuries and includes ethnographic explorations of anarchist practices in eastern Europe in the 21st century.

For example, \"policy evaluation\" has become a buzzword in recent years in public management and examples involving Fels graduates-or their equivalents-abound.

Did Philadelphia's \"big belly\" trash cans actually reduce the amount of litter on our streets? Answering any of these questions requires statistical analysis. This course aims to lay the groundwork for you to answer these (and many more!) questions. The point here is not to convince you to adopt a quantitative design for your own work, or that quantitative designs are the \"best\" designs for answering all questions.

The choicest of client accounts entail complex, long-term strategic and technological investments and operational know-how that yield billions of dollars in annual revenue for consultants.  Yet do these firms act with their clients' best interests in mind?  What is at stake for clients’ reputations when consultants’ recommendations are implemented, but fail, whether at the cost of profit, the environment, or even human lives?  In this seminar, we will seek to answer these and related questions by engaging with Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe’s book When McKinsey Comes to Town: The Hidden Influence of the World’s Most Powerful Consulting Firm.  We will read case studies on McKinsey’s work in the tobacco and opioid industries, with global oil companies, and as advisors to the governments of China, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia.

We'll begin with renowned scholar of the emotions, Brene Brown, and her latest book, Atlas of the Heart, which explores 87 emotions and related experiences. What distinguishes Brown from many other scholars in this interdisciplinary field is that she writes to a generalist audience and connects the scholarship to everyday experiences. While her writing is very accessible, it's grounded in substantial research and has broad applications to health, wildlife/animal studies, urban planning, economics, education, childhood development, marketing, rhetoric, artificial intelligence, the arts -- in short, every situation that involves humans experiencing, interpreting, and reacting to their own and others' feelings. Brown is especially well known for her work on shame and vulnerability, and methods for becoming \"shame resilient,\" but her book addresses a rich range of studies and work on numerous emotions and the language we use to describe them. The book is also fascinating insofar as she designed it for contemporary readers/use, with a lot of art, graphics, cartoons, and breakout pages that are designed for social media use. After reading and analyzing this lively, thought-provoking book, students will develop research projects on topics of their choice and use their findings to write a research-based White Paper and an Op-Ed.
